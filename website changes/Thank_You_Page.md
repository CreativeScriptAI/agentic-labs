## FUNNEL CONTEXT

```
ENTRY 1 → Booked clarity call     → Lands here to prep
ENTRY 2 → Booked AI demo          → Lands here to get context
ENTRY 3 → Cold link (no booking)  → Lands here, converts to book
```

---

## PAGE STRUCTURE & COPY

---

### TRUST BADGE
*Top of page. Small. Above the headline. Builds credibility before they read a word.*

```
[PLACEHOLDER: Add when available]
Options: Clutch badge / G2 rating / "50+ AI systems built"

For now, use:
★★★★★  Trusted by founders in healthcare, real estate, 
        B2B SaaS & home services
```

---

### SECTION 1 — HERO
*This section will eventually hold a VIDEO of Aditya speaking directly to founders.
For now, use the text version below. Keep it short — the video will do the heavy lifting later.*

**[VIDEO PLACEHOLDER]**
```
When video is ready:
- Aditya, speaking directly to camera, founder-to-founder
- 60–90 seconds max
- Script: "Hey — if you just booked a call with us, or you're 
  thinking about it, here's exactly what we do and why it works."
- Tone: Casual. Real. No slides. Just Aditya talking.
```

**Text version (use until video is live):**

```
We build AI systems that run 
parts of your business autonomously.

Not tools. Not demos.
Systems that work in production — 24/7,
without you in the loop.
```

**Subtext (smaller, below):**
```

Walk away with a plan — not a pitch.

### SECTION 2 — WHY FOUNDERS WORK WITH US
*5 checkmark bullets. Styled with green checkmarks like the reference.
Each line is ONE idea. No wrapping on mobile.*

**Section label (small, above):**
```
WHY AGENTIC AI LABS
```

**Headline:**
```
Built by engineers.
Trusted by founders.
```

**Bullets:**
```
✅  3 technical co-founders — we build, we don't just consult.

✅  50+ AI systems shipped across healthcare, real estate, 
    SaaS & home services.

✅  Within 48 hours of kickoff, most clients have 
    a working prototype.

✅  We build systems that work in production — 
    not demos that break with real customers.

✅  After go-live: 30 days of active monitoring. 
    No disappearing act.
```

---

### SECTION 3 — STATS BAR
*3 columns. Clean numbers. Exactly like the reference image.*

```
┌──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
│      50+     │      4+      │     48hrs    │
│   Projects   │  Industries  │  To Kickoff  │
└──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘
```

**Industries (below the stat bar):**
```
Healthcare · Real Estate · B2B SaaS · Home Services
```

---

### SECTION 4 — TRUSTED BY / PAST CLIENTS
*Logo strip or text strip. Use real clients only.*

**Section label:**
```
WORKED WITH FOUNDERS IN
```

**Text version (until logos are ready):**
```
PatientlyAI · [Add client] · [Add client] · [Add client]
```

**[PLACEHOLDER NOTE]:**
```
Add real client logos here once approved.
Do NOT use placeholder logos — leave as text until confirmed.
```

---

### SECTION 5 — TESTIMONIAL
*One strong quote. Large text. Authentic — no corporate tone.*

```
"Within 48 hours they built an AI caller 
that doubled our booking rate.

It feels like having a full-time receptionist 
who never sleeps."

— Aiden, Founder
```

**[PLACEHOLDER: Add 1–2 more when ready]**
```
Rules for testimonials:
- Outcome-specific only ("doubled booking rate" not "super underrated")
- Real name or role minimum
- Short enough to read in one breath
```

---

### SECTION 6 — WHAT HAPPENS ON THE CALL
*For post-bookers and cold leads both. Simple 3-step.*

**Section label:**
```
WHAT TO EXPECT
```

**Headline:**
```
30 minutes. A plan. Zero pitch.
```

**Steps:**
```
① We look at your business and your workflows.

② We map your #1 AI opportunity — 
   ranked by time and money saved.

③ You leave with a clear "build this first" plan.
   Not a proposal. Not a follow-up. A plan.
```

---

### SECTION 7 — FINAL CTA
*For cold leads who haven't booked yet.
For post-bookers this acts as a closing confirmation.*

**Headline:**
```
Your business runs.
Your AI should too.
```

**Body:**
```
Free. 30 minutes. Specific to your business.

No pitch. No pressure.
Just a straight answer on where AI 
fits in your operations.
```

**CTA:**
```
[→ Book Your Free AI Clarity Call]
```

**Below button (risk reversal):**
```
Worst case: 30 minutes. You know where you stand.
Best case: You find an opportunity worth $X,XXX/month.
```

---

### SECTION 8 — FOOTER CLOSE
*Personal. Human. Aditya's voice.*

```
— Aditya
Founder, Agentic AI Labs
tryagentikai.com

P.S. Questions before the call? 
Reply to your confirmation email. 
I read every one.
