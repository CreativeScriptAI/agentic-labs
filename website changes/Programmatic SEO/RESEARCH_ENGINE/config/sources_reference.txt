  SOURCE 5 — JOB MARKET INTELLIGENCE
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Primary:      BLS OEWS data (same API as Source 1 — employment count)
  Secondary:    Public Indeed search results (HTML scrape of result count)
  URL:          https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q={title}&l=United+States
  Auth:         None (public search page)
  Rate limit:   Be respectful — add delays between requests
  Update cycle: Indeed updates in real-time; BLS data annually
  Citation:     "Source: Indeed job search, [date]" or "Source: BLS OEWS [year]"
  What to cite: Open job count, salary range from postings, top cities

  NOTE ON INDEED SCRAPING:
    Indeed does not have a public API. The script reads the result count from
    the search page HTML. This can break if Indeed updates their HTML structure.
    If the script fails, check the CSS selector in node_05_job_market.py and
    update it to match the current page structure.

    Fallback: Use BLS employment count from Node 1 as the denominator instead.
