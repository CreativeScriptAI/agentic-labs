  ── THE PROBLEM ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  [SECTION LABEL]  THE PROBLEM

  [H2]
    Your front desk is your most expensive bottleneck.

  [BODY]

    If you run a dental practice, your front desk staff spends 4–6 hours
    every day answering the same calls. Appointment booking. Rescheduling.
    Insurance questions. Confirmation reminders.

    Good people. Expensive hours. Repetitive work.

    The median dental receptionist salary is $37,230 per year — that's
    according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. For that money, you
    get someone who can only answer one call at a time, can't work after
    5pm, and is probably already stretched too thin.

    And that's when someone picks up. When they're busy with a patient at
    the desk, the phone rings out. When the office is closed, the call goes
    to voicemail. Most patients don't leave a message. They just call the
    next dentist.

    Here's what that actually costs you:

  [COST CALLOUT BLOCK]
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Front desk salary (median, BLS 2024):         $37,230 / year
    Missed appointments from unavailability:      ~$30,000 / year
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Total annual problem:                          $67,000+ / year
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    We solve it for:    $2,000–$5,000 setup + $800–$2,000/month
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    That's $11,600 in Year 1. You save $55,000+.

  [PRACTITIONER VOICE CALLOUT — from Reddit research, Feb 2026]

    "I went from 12 patients a day to 28 in a year and a half.
    The problem is my overhead has scaled way faster than my revenue.
    I started with one front desk person and one MA. I've now added
    a second MA and a billing coordinator, and I still need more help.
    My margins are getting eaten alive."

    — Practice owner, r/smallbusiness, February 2026

    [NOTE FOR DEV: Display this as a pull-quote callout block.
     This is a real verbatim post with 192 upvotes — do not paraphrase.]

  [BODY CONTINUED]

    You've probably tried to fix this already.

    Maybe you hired a second front desk person. Expensive, and they still
    can't be in two places at once. Maybe you tried an answering service —
    impersonal, can't actually book appointments. That's not a coincidence:
    searches for "dental answering service" have dropped 88% over the last
    12 months (Google Trends). Practices are realising that services that
    just take a message don't solve anything.

    Maybe you got a chatbot. It answered FAQs on your website but had no
    idea how to get someone into your calendar.

    The problem isn't the tools. The problem is that none of them close the
    loop. Someone still has to follow through.

    That's what an AI receptionist does. It closes the loop — every time.

  ── INDUSTRY SIGNAL ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  [H2]
    The dental industry is already moving.

  [BODY]

    As of February 2026, DECA Dental Group — one of the largest dental
    groups in the US — has deployed Pearl AI as its exclusive AI partner
    across clinics in nine states. According to Dentistry Today (Feb 25, 2026):

    "DECA's decision follows a successful pilot study."

    This isn't a trend. It's a shift. The practices that move first keep
    their patients. The ones that wait watch those patients call back
    after someone else picked up.

  ── WHAT WE BUILD ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  [SECTION LABEL]  WHAT WE BUILD

  [H2]
    Talk. Remember. Act.
    One AI system. Three layers. Zero missed calls.

  [INTRO]
    We don't sell you a voice agent. We don't sell you an automation.
    We build one AI Receptionist for your dental practice where every layer
    is connected — and the whole thing runs without you in the loop.

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  [H3]  Layer 1: Your AI talks.

    It picks up every call. Appointment booking, rescheduling, insurance
    questions, hours, directions — handled in a real conversation, not a
    phone tree.

    New patients get qualified and booked in one call.
    Returning patients get treated like they've called before — because
    the AI knows them.

    Not a script. A real conversation. 24/7, including after-hours and weekends.

    Built on production-grade voice infrastructure. Not a chatbot. Not a
    phone tree. A voice that sounds like someone who works at your practice.

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  [H3]  Layer 2: Your AI remembers.

    Every patient. Every preference. Every conversation.

    Mrs. Garcia called last Tuesday about rescheduling. She mentioned she
    prefers morning slots. When she calls again, your AI already knows.
    She doesn't repeat herself. She doesn't feel like a number.

    The memory layer learns your patients over time. The AI gets smarter
    every month. Returning callers get a better experience every call.

    Built on Mem0 — a persistent memory layer that compounds with every
    interaction. Unlike a CRM lookup, this is contextual. The AI
    understands the conversation, not just the data field.

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  [H3]  Layer 3: Your AI acts.

    Your AI Receptionist doesn't just take a message. It takes action.

    ✓  Books directly into your scheduling software
       (Dentrix, Open Dental, Athena, Eaglesoft — whatever you use)
    ✓  Sends an SMS confirmation to the patient immediately
    ✓  Sends a T-24hr reminder call before the appointment — automatically
    ✓  Updates your patient records with call notes
    ✓  Flags complex questions for your staff to follow up

    No human in the loop for routine calls.
    Your team handles the patients in the chair — not the ones on the phone.

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  [CLOSING LINE]

    Most AI gives you one of these layers. We connect all three into one
    system that runs your front desk — 24/7, without you touching anything.

    That's the difference between a demo and a system.

  ── HOW WE BUILD IT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  [SECTION LABEL]  HOW IT WORKS

  [H2]
    From "I need an AI receptionist" to "it's live."
    Four weeks.

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Week 1 — AUDIT

    We spend a week understanding your practice. How calls come in.
    Common questions your front desk handles. Your scheduling software.
    Appointment types. Insurance accepted. After-hours protocol.

    You spend:   1 hour on a call with us.
    We deliver:  A clear spec of exactly what the AI will handle.

  Week 2 — BUILD

    We build the AI Receptionist. Voice agent, patient memory, scheduling
    integration, confirmation automation — all connected, all integrated with
    your existing tools.

    You spend:   Nothing. We build.

  Week 3 — TEST

    We run real-world call scenarios. New patients. Returning patients.
    Confused callers. Angry callers. Edge cases your front desk has seen.
    We break it on purpose so it doesn't break with your patients.

    You spend:   30 minutes reviewing and giving us feedback.

  Week 4 — LIVE

    Your AI Receptionist goes live. We monitor every call for the first
    30 days. We optimize phrasing. We tune confidence thresholds.
    You get a dashboard showing calls handled, appointments booked, and
    any calls that escalated to a human.

    You spend:   Zero. It runs without you.

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  [CLOSING LINE]

    After week 4, your AI handles every routine call.
    Your front desk handles your patients.

  [SECTION LABEL]  RESULTS

  [H2]
    We don't say "trust us."
    We show you what we built.

  [FEATURED RESULT]

    DENTAL PRACTICE — HEALTHCARE
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    The problem:
    A dental practice was losing an estimated $30K/year in missed appointments.
    Their front desk handled 150+ calls per week. After-hours calls went to
    voicemail. Most patients didn't leave a message.

    The system we built:
    AI Receptionist with voice (ElevenLabs) + patient memory (Mem0) +
    scheduling automation (Dentrix integration). Handles appointment booking,
    rescheduling, insurance queries, and sends SMS confirmations automatically.
    After-hours calls fully covered.

    The result:
    300+ calls handled per month. 85% resolved without any human intervention.
    Front desk staff time freed for in-practice patient management.
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  [TESTIMONIAL]

    "Within 48 hours they built an AI caller that doubled our booking rate.
    It feels like having a full-time receptionist who never sleeps."
    — Aiden, Founder

  [PROOF STATS ROW]

    300+               85%                   4 weeks
    calls/month        resolved without       from audit
    handled            human intervention     to live

  [MARKET CONTEXT BLOCK — from research]

    There are over 1,000,000 receptionist roles in the US
    (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2024) — and 128,500 dental receptionist
    positions open every year. That's not a talent problem.
    That's a systems problem. One AI system handles what 128,500 job
    postings are trying to hire for.

  ── IS THIS FOR YOU? ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  [SECTION LABEL]  IS THIS FOR YOU?

  [H2]
    Built for dental practices that have a phone problem.

  This is for you if:

    ✓  You handle 100+ inbound calls per week
    ✓  Your front desk is spending more time on the phone than with patients
    ✓  You're missing after-hours or lunchtime calls and losing bookings
    ✓  You've tried an answering service and it couldn't actually book appointments
    ✓  Your budget is $5K+ and you're serious about solving this properly

  This is NOT for you if:

    ✗  You need a $500 chatbot on your website
    ✗  You have fewer than 50 calls per week (not enough volume for AI ROI)
    ✗  You want to manage and maintain the AI system yourself

  [GEOGRAPHIC NOTE — from research]

    Searches for "AI receptionist dental" are highest in North Carolina,
    Florida, California, Texas, and New York (Google Trends, February 2026).
    If your practice is in one of these states, you're in the market where
    this is already being adopted ahead of you.

  ── FAQ ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  [SECTION LABEL]  QUESTIONS

  [H2]
    You're probably wondering.

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Q: How is this different from a dental answering service?

  A: Answering services take messages. They can't book appointments, access
     your scheduling software, or remember past conversations. You still
     need someone to call the patient back to follow through. That's why
     searches for "dental answering service" are down 88% on Google —
     practices have already been through that experience and moved on.
     Our AI Receptionist closes the loop completely: it books the
     appointment, sends the confirmation, and remembers the patient
     the next time they call. No follow-up required.

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Q: What scheduling software does it integrate with?

  A: We integrate with the software you already use: Dentrix, Open Dental,
     Athena, Eaglesoft, and most practice management systems with an API.
     We use GHL or n8n for the automation layer depending on your setup.
     If you're unsure — just ask us on the call. We'll tell you in 5 minutes.

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Q: What if the AI says something wrong to a patient?

  A: Every system is tested with real-world scenarios — including edge cases,
     angry patients, insurance questions, and unusual requests — before it
     handles a single real call. We build guardrails: topics the AI will
     always escalate to a human (e.g., complaints, clinical questions). The
     patient gets a smooth transfer. They never know the switch happened.
     We also monitor every call for the first 30 days and adjust as needed.

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Q: Can it handle after-hours calls and weekends?

  A: Yes. That's one of the main reasons dental practices use it. Calls that
     come in at 9pm, Saturday morning, or during a busy stretch when nobody
     can pick up — the AI handles them the same as any other call. A patient
     who calls at 10pm gets booked and confirmed. They're in your calendar
     before you open on Monday.

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Q: How does the memory actually work?

  A: We use Mem0 (persistent memory infrastructure) to store conversation
     context per patient. When a returning patient calls, the AI already
     knows their name, appointment history, and any preferences they've
     mentioned. They never have to repeat themselves. The memory compounds —
     the longer the system runs, the better it knows your patients.

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Q: How much does it cost?

  A: Dental practice AI Receptionist systems start at $2,000–$5,000 for the
     initial build, with $800–$2,000/month for ongoing monitoring and
     optimization. Every project is scoped based on your call volume, tools,
     and specific workflows. We'll give you a clear number before you commit
     to anything. No vague estimates.

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Q: What happens after the first 30 days?

  A: You can extend with a monthly maintenance plan. We watch the system,
     tune it as your workflows evolve, and ship updates when you add new
     services or change your scheduling rules. Most practices keep us on
     because the AI keeps getting better with every call it handles.
