  ── PROBLEM ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Section label:  THE PROBLEM

  H2:
    Your front desk is overwhelmed with routine calls.

  Body:
    If you run a medical clinic, your front desk staff spends half their day answering 
    the same questions. Appointment booking. Rescheduling. Checking insurance accepted. 
    Asking for directions. 
    
    The median medical receptionist salary safely sits around $38,500 per year. For that 
    money, you get someone who can only answer one call at a time, goes home at 5pm, 
    and is pulled away every time a patient stands in front of them at the desk.

    When that happens, the phone rings out. Or patients leave voicemails that take 
    hours to return. The result? New patients call the next clinic on Google, and 
    existing patients get frustrated. It's a lose-lose.

    You've probably tried to fix this. An answering service that just takes messages. 
    A clunky phone tree. A basic chatbot. None of them close the loop — someone still 
    has to follow up. That's what an AI receptionist fixes. It closes the loop.

  Pain cost callout (styled block):
    Medical Receptionist (Salary):        ~$38,500 / yr
    Missed after-hours appointments:      ~$35,000 / yr
    ───────────────────────────────────────────────
    Total problem:                        $73,500+ / yr
    We solve it for:                      ~$11,600 in Year 1

  Data Callouts:
    - "My no show rate is atrocious - easily 60-70%. Families confirm they will be here the day before then suddenly change their minds." — r/medicine community member (397 upvotes, Oct 2025)

  ── WHAT WE BUILD ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Section label:  WHAT WE BUILD

  H2:
    Talk. Remember. Act.
    One AI system. Three layers. Zero missed calls.

  Intro line:
    We don't sell you a voice agent. We don't sell you an automation.
    We build one AI Receptionist for your medical clinic where every layer is connected — 
    and the whole thing runs without you in the loop.

  Layer 1 – Voice:
    [H3] Your AI talks.
    [Body] Picks up every call — 24/7 including after-hours and weekends. Handles booking, 
    rescheduling, basic clinic FAQs, triage routing. Not a robotic phone tree. A real 
    conversation that sounds natural and empathetic.

  Layer 2 – Memory:
    [H3] Your AI remembers.
    [Body] Built on Mem0 — persistent memory that compounds with use. When a returning patient 
    calls, the AI already knows their name and appointment history. They never have to 
    repeat themselves. 

  Layer 3 – Automation:
    [H3] Your AI acts.
    [Body] Books directly into your EMR/EHR (Athena, Epic, advancedMD, or via API). 
    Sends SMS confirmations instantly. Fires T-24hr reminder calls automatically to 
    combat atrocious no-show rates. No human in the loop for routine calls.

  Closing line:
    Most AI gives you one of these layers. We connect all three into one system that 
    runs your front desk ops — 24/7, without you touching anything.

  ── HOW WE BUILD IT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Section label:  HOW IT WORKS

  H2:
    From "I need an AI receptionist" to "it's live."
    Four weeks.

  Step 1 – Week 1  AUDIT
    We spend a week understanding your clinic — how calls come in, triage protocols, 
    your scheduling software, appointment types, insurance accepted, after-hours protocol.
    You spend: 1 hour on a call with us.
    We deliver: A clear spec of exactly what the AI will handle.

  Step 2 – Week 2  BUILD
    We build the AI Receptionist. Voice agent, patient memory, EMR integration, 
    confirmation automation — all connected, all integrated with your existing tools.
    You spend: Nothing. We build.

  Step 3 – Week 3  TEST
    We run real-world call scenarios. New patients. Returning patients. Confused callers. 
    We break it on purpose so it doesn't break with your patients.
    You spend: 30 minutes reviewing and giving us feedback.

  Step 4 – Week 4  LIVE
    Your AI Receptionist goes live. We monitor every call for the first 30 days. 
    We optimize phrasing and tune confidence thresholds. 
    You spend: Zero. It runs without you.

  ── FAQ ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Section label:  QUESTIONS

  H2:  You're probably wondering.

  Q: How is this different from a medical answering service?
  A: Answering services just take messages and send you a transcript perfectly designed to create more work for your staff the next morning. They can't book appointments, access your EMR, or remember past conversations. Our AI closes the loop completely: books the appointment, sends the confirmation, remembers the patient next time.

  Q: Will it violate HIPAA?
  A: We use HIPAA-compliant providers and enterprise-grade security for the voice models, memory layer, and downstream automation. We sign BAAs where required. Patient PHI is handled securely.

  Q: What EMR / scheduling software does it integrate with?
  A: We integrate with the software you already use: Athena, AdvancedMD, Epic, DrChrono, and most practice management systems with an API. If you're unsure — ask us on the call. We'll tell you in 5 minutes.

  Q: What if a patient has a severe medical emergency?
  A: It is explicitly instructed to immediately redirect emergencies to 911 or a human triage nurse. Every system is tested with real-world edge cases to ensure rigid guardrails on clinical questions before it handles a single real call.

  Q: Can it handle after-hours calls and weekends?
  A: Yes — that's one of the main reasons medical clinics use it. Calls at 9pm or Saturday morning are handled the same as any other call. A patient who calls at 10pm gets booked and confirmed. They're in your calendar before you open on Monday.

  Q: How much does it cost?
  A: Medical clinic AI Receptionist systems start at $2,000–$5,000 for the initial build, with $800–$2,000/month for ongoing monitoring, optimization, and call minutes. Every project is scoped to your call volume, tools, and workflows.
