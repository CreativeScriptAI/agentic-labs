  Section label:  THE PROBLEM

  H2:
    [State the specific pain of THIS industry in plain language.]
    Example: "Your front desk is your bottleneck."

  Body:
    [2–4 short paragraphs. Write like a founder talking to another founder.
    Name specific scenarios. Use concrete numbers from the ICP doc.
    Structure: What is happening → How much it costs → Why it's getting worse.]

    Paragraph 1: The daily reality (what's actually happening in their business)

  ── WHAT WE BUILD ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Section label:  WHAT WE BUILD

  H2:
    Talk. Remember. Act.
    One AI system. Three layers. [Industry-specific closer.]
    Example: "Zero missed calls."

  Intro line:
    We don't sell you a voice agent. We don't sell you an automation.
    We build one AI [Role] where everything is connected.

  Layer 1 – Voice:
    [H3] Your AI talks.
    [Body] [Describe specifically what the AI says and does on calls in this
    industry. Name the exact scenarios: appointment booking, insurance questions,
    lead qualification, etc. 2–3 lines max.]

  Layer 2 – Memory:
    [H3] Your AI remembers.
    [Body] [Describe what memory means in this specific industry context.
    "Returning patients never repeat themselves." Specific, not generic. 2–3 lines.]

  Layer 3 – Automation:
    [H3] Your AI acts.
    [Body] [List the specific downstream actions: "Books into [their software].
    Updates [their CRM]. Sends confirmation via SMS. Triggers a reminder 24h before."]
    Name real tools they use: Dentrix, GHL, Salesforce, Calendly, etc.

  Closing line:
    Most AI gives you one of these. We connect all three.
    That's the difference between a demo and a system that runs your [industry] ops.

  ── HOW WE BUILD IT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Section label:  HOW IT WORKS

  H2:
    From "I need AI" to "my AI is live."
    Four weeks.

  Step 1 – Week 1  AUDIT
    We map your workflows. Every call, every follow-up, every manual task in
    your [industry] operation. We identify exactly what the AI handles and what
    stays human.
    You spend: 1 hour on a call with us.
    We deliver: A clear plan for what we're building.

  Step 2 – Week 2  BUILD
    We build the AI [Role]. Voice agent, memory layer, automation workflows —
    all connected, all integrated with [their tools: e.g. Dentrix / GHL / ATS].
    You spend: Nothing. We build.

  Step 3 – Week 3  TEST
    Real scenarios. Real edge cases. The weird calls. The angry patients. We
    break it on purpose so it doesn't break with your customers.
    You spend: 30 minutes reviewing and giving feedback.

  Step 4 – Week 4  LIVE
    Your AI [Role] goes live. We monitor every interaction for the first 30 days.
    You get a dashboard: calls handled, appointments booked, issues flagged.
    You spend: Zero. It runs without you.

  ── PROOF ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Section label:  RESULTS

  H2:
    We don't say "trust us."
    We show you what we built.

  Featured result (when available — use placeholder until real case study):
    [INDUSTRY] CLIENT
    The problem:  [1 sentence — specific]
    The system:   [What we built — voice + memory + automation, named specifically]
    The result:   [Numbers: calls, bookings, tickets, time saved]
    [Quote if available]

  Proof stat row (3 callouts):
    [STAT 1]   [STAT 2]   [STAT 3]
    Example: "300 calls handled" / "85% resolved without human" / "4 weeks to live"

  ── IS THIS FOR YOU ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Section label:  IS THIS FOR YOU?

  H2:
    Built for [industry type] who have traction but not enough time.

    ✓  You handle [X]+ [calls / tickets / inquiries] per [week/month]

    ✓  Your budget is $5K+ and you're serious about making AI actually work
    ✓  You want a system that runs without you — not another tool to manage

  This is NOT for you if:
    ✗  You need a $500 chatbot
    ✗  You want to "explore AI" with no specific pain to solve
    ✗  You want to manage and maintain the AI yourself

  ── FAQ ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Section label:  QUESTIONS

  H2:  You're probably wondering.

  [Minimum 4 Q&As — use industry-specific answers, not generic ones]
  [These also serve as the FAQPage schema markup]

  Q: How is this different from [closest competitor / tool they use]?

     "Vapi gives you voice. No memory. The AI forgets every conversation.
     We build the full system — voice + memory + automation, connected."]

  Q: What does it integrate with?
  A: [Name tools specifically relevant to their industry.]

  Q: What happens if the AI says something wrong?

  Q: How long does it take?
  A: [Standard — 4 weeks. Week 1 audit. Week 2 build. Week 3 test. Week 4 live.]

    Your [industry] runs.
    Your AI should too.

  Body:

    like for your [industry] — and whether it even makes sense.
    No pitch. No pressure. Just a straight answer.
