  Quote:      "When I started my HVAC company in 1994 with $3,200, I watched competitors race to the bottom on pricing. I went the opposite direction. Here’s what I did instead: I stopped selling air conditioners and started selling peace of mind. Every customer got a 10-year labor guarantee - not the standard 1-2 years, but a full decade.
