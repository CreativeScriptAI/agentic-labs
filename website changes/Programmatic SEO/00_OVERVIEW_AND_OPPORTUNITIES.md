## What Programmatic SEO IS for This Business

Instead of writing one blog post at a time, you create **page templates** that get filled in with structured data — at scale. Google indexes all of them and you capture traffic you'd never rank for with just your homepage.

You already have:
- A country routing system (`/en-us`, `/en-gb`, `/en-in`, `/en-au`, `/en-ae`, `/en-ca`)  
- A clear ICP: healthcare, real estate, recruiting, home services, e-commerce, B2B SaaS  
- A set of named AI roles: AI Receptionist, AI Interviewer, AI Support Rep, AI Showing Coordinator, AI Dispatch Agent, AI SDR  
- Integrations you support: GoHighLevel, HubSpot, Salesforce, Calendly, Stripe, Twilio, Zendesk, Slack

These are your **data axes**. Every combination can become a ranked page.

## Technical Notes (Next.js Specific)

- **Rendering:** Use `getStaticProps` + `getStaticPaths` to pre-generate all pages from a JSON/TS data file
- **Sitemap:** The existing `sitemap.xml.tsx` needs to be extended to include all pSEO pages
- **Internal links:** Every pSEO page links back to the main homepage CTA and to 2–3 related pSEO pages
- **No orphan pages:** Every page must also be linked from a hub page (e.g. `/ai-receptionist` links to all sub-pages)
- **Schema:** Each page gets `Service` schema and `FAQPage` schema
