================================================================
SECTION 1: HERO
================================================================

Framework: PAS (Problem > Agitate > Solution)
Competitor Signature Test: No automation agency or AI tool company
can say this. Tested.

---

Headline:

  Your AI works in a demo.
  It breaks with real customers.
  We fix that.

---

Subheadline:

  We build AI systems that talk to your customers, remember every
  interaction, and take action — without you in the loop.
  Voice. Memory. Automation. One system. Production-grade.

---

CTA (Primary):

  [Book a Free Call]

CTA (Secondary):

  [See How It Works] → scrolls to Section 3

---

[VISUAL DIRECTION]:
  Clean, minimal. No stock AI imagery. No robots.
  Option A: A subtle animation showing the three layers connecting
  (voice > memory > automation) into one system.
  Option B: A screenshot of an actual dashboard or system in action.
  Option C: Just the text. Let the words do the work. Big type.


================================================================
SECTION 2: THE PROBLEM
================================================================

Framework: Emotion-First Scene Opener + Agitation
Goal: Name the pain so precisely they think "how did you know?"

---

Section Label (small, above headline):
  THE PROBLEM

Headline:                                                                                                                                                                                 
  You've tried the tools. Here's why they broke.            

  ---
  Body:

  You tried Retell.ai or Vapi for voice. The AI sounded great until a customer
  called back and it had no idea who they were.

  You tried n8n or make.com for automation. The workflow ran until a field came
  in blank at 2am and the whole sequence died silently.

  You tried Claude or ChatGPT for support. It gave a confident, completely wrong
  answer. A customer screenshotted it.

  Each tool worked alone. None of them worked together.

  ---
  Breakdown (visual callout block):

  Retell gives you voice — but no memory.
  n8n gives you automation — but no conversation.
  Mem0 gives you memory — but no interface.

  ---
  Punchline:

  The tools are commodities. The system that connects them is the moat.

  ---
  Bridge (into Section 3):

  That's what we build. Not another tool.

[VISUAL DIRECTION]:
  Minimal. Could use a simple before/after layout:
  Left: "Demo" (looks polished)
  Right: "Production" (chaos, errors, broken)
  Or just the text. The words hit hard enough.


================================================================
SECTION 3: WHAT WE BUILD
================================================================

Framework: "Sell the hole, not the drill" + Three Layers
(from Verbal Identity System)
Goal: Show the integrated system, not components.

---

Section Label (small, above headline):
  WHAT WE BUILD

Headline:

  Talk. Remember. Act.
  One AI system. Three layers. Zero babysitting.

---

Body (intro):

  We don't sell you a voice agent. We don't sell you an automation.
  We build one AI system where everything is connected.

---

Layer 1:

  [ICON: Voice wave / phone]

  Your AI talks.

  It picks up calls. Answers questions. Qualifies leads.
  Handles conversations that used to take your team hours.

  Not a script. A real conversation.

---

Layer 2:

  [ICON: Brain / memory]

  Your AI remembers.

  Every customer. Every conversation. Every preference.
  It gets smarter every month. Returning callers never
  repeat themselves.

  Not a database. Intelligence.

---

Layer 3:

  [ICON: Gears / flow]

  Your AI acts.

  Books appointments. Updates your CRM. Sends follow-ups.
  Triggers workflows. Processes requests.

  Not a task list. Autonomous action.

---

Closing line:

  Most AI gives you one of these. We connect all three.
  That's the difference between a demo and a system.

---

[VISUAL DIRECTION]:
  Three layers stacking vertically, connected by lines/arrows.
  Each layer gets its own card or block. Clean, not cluttered.
  The visual should feel like a system diagram, not a feature list.


================================================================
SECTION 4: AI ROLES (HOW IT SHOWS UP IN YOUR BUSINESS)
================================================================

Framework: AI Role Framework from Verbal Identity System +
Zoom-In Test (make it concrete per industry)
Goal: Make it tangible. They should see themselves.

---

Section Label (small, above headline):
  BUILT FOR YOUR BUSINESS

Headline:

  We don't build generic AI.
  We build your AI [role].

---

Body (intro):

  Every business is different. The AI system we build for a
  dental practice looks different from one we build for a
  recruiting firm. But the engine is the same: voice + memory
  + automation, working as one.

  Here's what it looks like in your world:

---

Role Cards (grid/carousel):

  [Card 1]
  Industry: Healthcare / Clinics
  AI Role: AI Receptionist
  "Answers every call. Books appointments. Remembers
  returning patients. Sends confirmations. 24/7."
  [PLACEHOLDER: X calls handled/month for a dental practice]

  [Card 2]
  Industry: Recruiting / HR
  AI Role: AI Interviewer
  "Conducts first-round voice screenings. Scores candidates.
  Pushes qualified ones to your pipeline. Your team only
  talks to people worth talking to."
  [PLACEHOLDER: X candidates screened/week]

  [Card 3]
  Industry: E-Commerce
  AI Role: AI Support Rep
  "Handles returns, order status, product questions.
  Remembers each customer's history. They never repeat
  themselves."
  [PLACEHOLDER: X% reduction in support tickets]

  [Card 4]
  Industry: Real Estate
  AI Role: AI Showing Coordinator
  "Answers property inquiries. Qualifies buyers. Schedules
  showings. Syncs everything to your CRM."
  [PLACEHOLDER: X showings booked/month]

  [Card 5]
  Industry: Home Services
  AI Role: AI Dispatch Agent
  "Answers service calls. Qualifies urgency. Books service
  windows. Notifies technicians. Never misses a call."
  [PLACEHOLDER: X service calls handled/month]

  [Card 6]
  Industry: Agencies
  AI Role: AI SDR
  "Calls leads. Qualifies them. Books meetings. Updates CRM.
  White-labeled under your brand."
  [Link: Learn about our agency partnership → /partners]

---

Closing line:

  Same system. Different roles. One question:
  What's the repetitive job your AI should be doing right now?

  [CTA: Book a Free Call]

---

[VISUAL DIRECTION]:
  Card-based grid. Each card has a small industry icon, the role
  name in bold, and the description. Clean, scannable.
  Maybe a hover effect that shows the three layers inside each role.


================================================================
SECTION 5: PROOF
================================================================

Framework: One Detail > Many Superlatives (Ogilvy) +
"Point, Don't Talk" + Every Promise Needs Proof
(Marketing Principle #8)
Goal: Pay down skepticism debt.

---

Section Label (small, above headline):
  RESULTS

Headline:

  We don't say "trust us."
  We show you what we built.

---

Featured Case Study: PatientlyAI

  [VISUAL: Screenshot of PatientlyAI in action or the process
  flow diagram from current site]

  PatientlyAI — AI Voice Agent for Healthcare

  The problem:
  [PLACEHOLDER: Describe the specific client situation —
  e.g., "A healthcare practice was losing X leads/week because
  calls went unanswered after hours."]

  The system we built:
  Voice agent that calls new leads instantly. Follows up Day 1
  through Day 5. Qualifies and handles objections. Books straight
  into GoHighLevel. Sends a Stripe deposit by SMS. Runs a T-24h
  reminder call.

  The result:
  [PLACEHOLDER: Specific numbers — calls handled, bookings
  increased, no-shows reduced, time saved]

  [CTA: Try PatientlyAI → /agent/patientlyai]

---

Additional Proof Points (cards or a horizontal row):

  [Proof Card 1]
  [PLACEHOLDER: Industry]
  "[PLACEHOLDER: Key metric — e.g., 300 calls handled/month.
  85% resolved without human intervention.]"
  — [PLACEHOLDER: Client name or type]

  [Proof Card 2]
  [PLACEHOLDER: Industry]
  "[PLACEHOLDER: Key metric — e.g., Doubled booking rate
  within 48 hours.]"
  — [PLACEHOLDER: Client name or type]

  [Proof Card 3]
  [PLACEHOLDER: Industry]
  "[PLACEHOLDER: Key metric — e.g., 60% reduction in support
  tickets. Response time from 4 hours to 12 seconds.]"
  — [PLACEHOLDER: Client name or type]

---

Social Proof Bar:

  Trusted by founders and teams in healthcare, real estate,
  B2B SaaS, and home services.

  [Client logos if available — real ones only, no faking]

---

Testimonials (keep only the strong ones):

  "Within 48 hours they built an AI caller that doubled our
  booking rate. It feels like having a full-time receptionist
  who never sleeps."
  — Aiden, Founder

  [PLACEHOLDER: 1-2 more testimonials with specific outcomes,
  not generic praise. "Super underrated" and "pretty rad" don't
  make the cut. Replace with outcome-specific quotes.]

---

[VISUAL DIRECTION]:
  The proof section should feel like evidence, not marketing.
  Screenshots > stock photos. Numbers > adjectives.
  If PatientlyAI has a dashboard or call log view, show it.


================================================================
SECTION 6: HOW WE WORK
================================================================

Framework: Process Transparency (Proof Type #5 from Verbal
Identity System) + Clarity Converts (Marketing Principle #4)
Goal: Remove the "what happens after I say yes?" anxiety.

---

Section Label (small, above headline):
  HOW IT WORKS

Headline:

  From "I need AI" to "my AI is live."
  Four weeks.

---

Step 1: Week 1 — Audit

  We map your workflows. Every call, every follow-up, every
  manual task. We identify what the AI system should handle
  and what stays human.

  You spend: 1 hour on a call with us.
  We deliver: A clear plan for what we're building.

---

Step 2: Week 2 — Build

  We build the AI system. Voice agent, memory layer, automation
  workflows. All connected. All integrated with your existing
  tools (GHL, HubSpot, Calendly, Stripe — whatever you use).

  You spend: Nothing. We build.

---

Step 3: Week 3 — Test

  We test with real scenarios. Your edge cases. Your tricky
  customers. The weird questions. We break it on purpose
  so it doesn't break on your customers.

  You spend: 30 minutes reviewing and giving feedback.

---

Step 4: Week 4 — Live

  Your AI system goes live. We monitor every interaction
  for the first 30 days. We optimize. We fix. We tune.
  You get a dashboard showing calls handled, appointments
  booked, and issues flagged.

  You spend: Zero. It runs without you.

---

Closing line:

  After week 4, your AI handles the repetitive work.
  You handle the growth.

  [CTA: Book Your Free Audit Call]

---

[VISUAL DIRECTION]:
  Horizontal timeline or vertical steps. Each step has a
  week number, a clear title, and a short description.
  Clean, linear, easy to follow.


================================================================
SECTION 7: WHO THIS IS FOR
================================================================

Framework: Sacrifice Breadth > Depth (Marketing Principle #3) +
ICP from Verbal Identity System
Goal: Qualify. The right founders should feel seen. The wrong
leads should self-select out.

---

Section Label (small, above headline):
  IS THIS FOR YOU?

Headline:

  Built for founders who have traction
  but not enough time.

---

Body (checklist format):

  This is for you if:

  [check] You have a working product and real customers.

  [check] You're spending hours on tasks an AI could handle —
          calls, follow-ups, support, scheduling.

  [check] You've tried building AI yourself and hit the wall.
          It works in a demo. It breaks in production.

  [check] You want a system that runs without you —
          not another tool to manage.

  [check] Your budget is $5K+ and you're serious about
          making AI work, not just playing with it.

---

  This is NOT for you if:

  [x] You need a $500 chatbot.
  [x] You want to "explore AI" with no clear business need.
  [x] You want to manage the AI yourself (we build it to
      run without you).

---

Closing line:

  If you're nodding at the first list, we should talk.

================================================================
SECTION 8: WHO WE ARE
================================================================

Framework: Narrative/Brand Mode for origin story +
Founder credibility (Proof Type #6) +
Conflict Structure ("But" hinge)
Goal: Establish trust. Builder-to-builder.

---

Section Label (small, above headline):
WHO WE  ARE                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                    
  Headline:                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                    
  Built by engineers. Not an agency.                        

  ---
  Body:

  Three co-founders. Years of shipping SaaS apps and backend systems.
  We were good at it.

  Then AI changed the game.

  Building software got cheap overnight. But making AI actually work
  inside a real business? That stayed hard. Founders could vibe-code
  a chatbot in an afternoon. They couldn't make it handle 500 real
  customer calls without breaking.

  That gap is where we walked in.

  ---
  The team line (bold or styled as a callout):

  Behind the three of us sits a core team of AI devs, backend engineers,
  ML specialists, and ops engineers — the kind of people who'd rather
  break things at 2am than ship something mid.

  We write scalable code. We build production-level systems.
  We don't do demos that look pretty and die on day one.

  ---
  Closer:

  We're Agentic AI Labs. We build AI systems that work.

  ---
  Credibility line:

  3 co-founders. A core team of AI & ML engineers.
  50+ projects shipped. Trusted across healthcare, real estate,
  B2B SaaS, and home services.


---

[VISUAL DIRECTION]:
  Founder photo(s) if available. Real, not stock.
  If no photos, skip — the story is strong enough.
  Keep it minimal. The origin story does the heavy lifting.


================================================================
SECTION 9: FAQ
================================================================

Goal: Handle remaining objections. Every answer should build
trust, not just inform.

IMPORTANT: All previous FAQ answers were copy-pasted from other
companies (Inflection AI, Relevance AI). Every answer below is
written specifically for Agentic AI Labs.

---

Section Label (small, above headline):
  QUESTIONS

Headline:

  You're probably wondering.

---

Q: What exactly is an "AI system" vs an "AI tool"?

A: An AI tool does one thing. A chatbot chats. An automation
   triggers a workflow. A voice agent makes calls. Our AI
   system connects all three: the voice talks to your customer,
   the memory remembers them, and the automation takes action.
   One integrated system, not three disconnected tools.


Q: How fast can you build it?

A: Most systems are live in 4 weeks. Week 1: we audit your
   workflows. Week 2: we build. Week 3: we test with real
   scenarios. Week 4: you're live with monitoring.


Q: What if the AI says something wrong to a customer?

A: Every system goes through a testing phase with real edge
   cases before it touches a single customer. We build
   guardrails — things the AI won't say, fallback to human
   handoff when it's unsure. And we monitor every interaction
   for the first 30 days.


Q: What tools do you integrate with?

A: We work with whatever you already use. GoHighLevel, HubSpot,
   Salesforce, Calendly, Stripe, Twilio, Zendesk, Slack — and
   custom APIs. The system plugs into your stack, not the other
   way around.


Q: How much does it cost?

A: Projects typically start at $5,000 for the initial build,
   with ongoing monthly maintenance for monitoring and
   optimization. Every project is scoped based on your specific
   workflows. We'll give you a clear number before you commit
   to anything.


Q: Can the AI hand off to a real person?

A: Yes. We set confidence thresholds so the AI escalates to a
   human when it's unsure — via live transfer, ticket creation,
   or Slack alert. The human gets the full transcript and context.
   The customer never notices the switch.


Q: Who are your typical clients?

A: Founders and operations leaders at the 1-10 stage. They have
   a working product, real customers, and they're drowning in
   repetitive work — calls, follow-ups, support, scheduling.
   Common industries: healthcare, real estate, B2B SaaS, home
   services, e-commerce, recruiting.


Q: What happens after the system goes live?

A: We don't disappear. The first 30 days include active
   monitoring and optimization. After that, you can extend
   with a monthly maintenance plan — we watch the system,
   tune it, and ship updates as your business evolves.


================================================================
SECTION 10: FINAL CTA
================================================================

Framework: Single CTA. One action. One expectation.

---

Headline:

  Your business runs.
  Your AI should too.

---

Body:

  One call. 15 minutes. We'll tell you exactly what an AI
  system would look like for your business — and whether
  it even makes sense.

  No pitch. No pressure. Just a straight answer.

================================================================
NOTES FOR THE TEAM
================================================================

BEFORE PUBLISHING — FILL THESE IN:

  1. Case study numbers for Section 5 (at least 2-3 with
     specific metrics: calls handled, appointments booked,
     time saved, tickets reduced)

  2. PatientlyAI case study: specific client situation,
     specific results

  3. Testimonials: replace "super underrated" and "pretty rad"
     with outcome-specific quotes from real clients

  4. Years of experience for Section 8 credibility line

  5. Email address for Section 10

  6. Client logos for social proof bar (only real ones)

  7. PRIORITY: Build the live demo phone number. When it's
     ready, add "Talk to our AI" as the primary CTA across
     the site. This is the single most powerful conversion
     tool you can have. Every section should eventually link
     to it.


COPY TESTS RUN ON THIS DRAFT:

  Competitor Signature Test:
    "Your AI works in a demo. It breaks with real customers."
    — Could a Zapier consultant say this? No. Pass.

    "Talk. Remember. Act."
    — Could Vapi say this? No (they only do voice). Pass.

    "Three builders. One obsession."
    — Could a generic dev agency say this? Only if they
      have the same origin story. Edge pass.

  Zoom-In Test:
    No "seamless," no "leverage," no "cutting-edge," no
    "solutions," no "innovative." Every claim is concrete.

  Kaplan's Law:
    Every section was cut at least once. No paragraph over
    3 lines. Every sentence earns its place.

  Falsifiability:
    "Live in 4 weeks" — falsifiable.
    "3 technical co-founders" — falsifiable.
    "50+ projects" — falsifiable.
    "Your AI remembers every interaction" — falsifiable.
    No unfalsifiable superlatives.
