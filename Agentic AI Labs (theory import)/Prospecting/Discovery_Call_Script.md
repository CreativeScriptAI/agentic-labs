# AGENTIC AI LABS: DISCOVERY CALL SCRIPT
**Consultant Mode: Diagnose, Don't Pitch**

---

## PHILOSOPHY

**From Founding Sales**: "You're a consultant with a predilection for a particular solution."

- **Old school**: "Sell ice to an Eskimo" (convince them to buy what they don't need)
- **New school**: Help them discover they have a problem worth solving, then reveal you have the solution

**The first 10 minutes of a meeting are for diagnosing the prospect, not talking.**

If they don't have the pain → End the call politely. Don't waste their time or yours.

---

## CALL STRUCTURE (30-45 minutes)

### MINUTES 0-3: THE OPENER (Set the Stage)

**Your opening:**

> "Thanks for jumping on. I know your time is valuable, so here's how I'd like to use the next 30 minutes:
> 
> **First 15 minutes**: I want to understand your business—what you're building, where things are working, and where you're hitting friction. I'll ask a bunch of questions.
> 
> **Next 10 minutes**: If it sounds like what we build is relevant, I'll show you a quick demo of a system we built for a [similar industry]. You can literally call a phone number and talk to the AI.
> 
> **Last 5 minutes**: We'll figure out if there's a fit. If there is, great—I'll send over a proposal. If there isn't, I'll tell you honestly and maybe point you to something better.
> 
> Sound good?"

**Why this works:**
- Sets expectations (no ambush pitch)
- Shows respect for their time
- Positions you as a consultant, not a salesperson
- "I'll tell you honestly if there's no fit" builds immediate trust

---

### MINUTES 3-15: DISCOVERY (Ask, Don't Tell)

**The Goal**: Understand three things:
1. **Do they have the problem?** (volume, pain, urgency)
2. **Can they afford to solve it?** (budget authority, willingness to pay)
3. **Do they have decision-making authority?** (or will they need to "run it by" someone else?)

---

#### DISCOVERY QUESTION SET 1: THE BUSINESS (Context)

**Q1: "Tell me about your business in 60 seconds—what do you sell, who are your customers?"**
- Listen for: Stage (early? scaling?), complexity (simple product or multi-sided marketplace?), customer type (B2B? B2C? Local businesses?)

**Q2: "How many people on the team right now?"**
- Listen for: 1-10 = sweet spot. 20+ = might be too complex/slow. Solo = might not have budget.

**Q3: "What's working really well right now?"**
- Listen for: Product-market fit signals, revenue growth, customer satisfaction
- **Why ask this**: You're diagnosing, not interrogating. Start with the positive.

---

#### DISCOVERY QUESTION SET 2: THE PAIN (Where It's Broken)

**Q4: "And where are things getting messy? What's not scaling as well as you'd like?"**
- Listen for: **Manual work, operational bottlenecks, founder time sink, hiring challenges**
- **If they don't mention customer interactions or admin work** → Probe deeper

**Q5: "Walk me through a typical day for you. Where does most of your time go?"**
- Listen for: "I spend 4 hours a day answering the same questions" / "I'm constantly in my CRM updating records" / "We're drowning in support tickets"
- **Red flag**: If they say "mostly strategy and growth" → They don't have operational pain. Probably not a fit.

**Q6: "How are you handling [customer calls / support tickets / scheduling / lead follow-up] right now?"**
- Listen for: Manual process, hiring plans, current tool usage
- **Probe**: "How's that working for you?" (Let them admit it's broken. Don't tell them.)

**Q7: "What happens when you're not available? Do things pile up, or does someone else handle it?"**
- Listen for: **Missed opportunities, bottlenecks, single points of failure**

---

#### DISCOVERY QUESTION SET 3: THE COST (Quantify the Pain)

**Q8: "If you had to guess, how many [calls / emails / tickets] are you getting per week?"**
- Listen for: **100+ = good signal. <50 = probably not enough volume to justify AI system.**

**Q9: "How much time is that costing you or your team per day?"**
- Listen for: **4-6 hours/day = acute pain. 30 minutes/day = not urgent.**

**Q10: "What does a missed [call / lead / ticket] cost you? Like, if someone calls and you don't answer, what's the downstream impact?"**
- Listen for: **Lost revenue, frustrated customers, damaged reputation**
- **This is the key question.** If they say "not much," they won't pay to solve it.

---

#### DISCOVERY QUESTION SET 4: WHAT THEY'VE TRIED (Status Quo)

**Q11: "Have you tried any tools or automation to solve this already?"**
- Listen for: Zapier, ChatGPT, Vapi, n8n, RingCentral, hired a VA
- **Follow-up**: "What happened? Why didn't that stick?"
- Listen for: "It broke," "Too complex," "Didn't work in production," "Humans were inconsistent"

**Q12: "Are you thinking about hiring someone for this, or are you looking for a system?"**
- Listen for: **If they say "hiring" → Reframe: "A full-time person is $40K+/year. What if I could show you a system that costs 1/4 of that and works 24/7?"**
- Listen for: **If they say "system" → They're already thinking the right way. Good sign.**

---

#### DISCOVERY QUESTION SET 5: BUDGET & TIMELINE (Qualification)

**Q13: "Have you budgeted for solving this, or is this more exploratory right now?"**
- Listen for: **"Yes, we were planning to hire" = budget exists. "Just exploring" = low intent.**

**Q14: "If we could solve this, how soon would you want it live?"**
- Listen for: **"ASAP" or "within a month" = urgency. "Maybe Q3" = no urgency, will ghost.**

**Q15: "Who else needs to be involved in this decision, or is it just you?"**
- Listen for: **Solo decision = fast close. "I need to check with my co-founder" = add them to the next call.**

---

### PAUSE POINT (Minute 15): QUALIFIED OR NOT?

**Internal Checklist** (Don't say this out loud, just evaluate):
- [ ] High-volume interactions (100+ per week)
- [ ] Acute pain (4+ hours/day spent on manual work)
- [ ] Quantifiable cost (missed revenue or hiring budget)
- [ ] Tried other solutions and failed
- [ ] Has budget or hiring budget they can reallocate
- [ ] Timeline is urgent (2-4 weeks, not 6 months)
- [ ] Decision-maker on the call

**If 5+ boxes are checked → QUALIFIED → Proceed to demo**

**If fewer than 4 → NOT QUALIFIED → Polite exit:**
> "Based on what you're describing, I don't think we're the right fit right now. What you need is [Zapier / a VA / a different solution]. We specialize in high-volume operational challenges, and it sounds like you're not quite there yet. But if that changes, happy to revisit."

**Why this is powerful**: You're not desperate. You're selective. This builds respect.

---

### MINUTES 15-25: THE DEMO (Show, Don't Tell)

**Transition:**
> "Okay, based on what you've described—[summarize their pain in their words]—I think what we build could be a good fit. Let me show you a quick example.
> 
> We built an AI [Receptionist / Interviewer / SDR] for a [dental practice / recruiting firm / agency] that was dealing with [similar pain]. Here's what it does..."

---

#### DEMO SCRIPT (Tailor to Their Domain)

**Example: Dental Practice**

> "This is an AI receptionist we built for a dental practice in Austin. It handles appointment booking, rescheduling, and patient questions—24/7.
> 
> Here's how it works:
> 1. Patient calls the main office number.
> 2. The AI picks up, sounds like a human receptionist, asks what they need.
> 3. If they want to book an appointment, the AI checks the calendar in real-time, offers available slots, and books it.
> 4. If they're a returning patient, the AI remembers them—pulls up their history, knows their last visit.
> 5. After the call, the AI updates the practice management software, sends a confirmation text, and logs the conversation.
> 
> Want to hear it? **Call this number: [DEMO NUMBER]**"

**CRITICAL**: **Shut up while they call the AI.** Let the demo sell itself.

---

#### AFTER THE DEMO

**They'll usually say**: "Wow, that's impressive. How does it work?"

**Your response (keep it simple):**
> "It's three layers working together:
> 1. **Voice layer**: The AI talks to your customers (phone, chat, SMS).
> 2. **Memory layer**: The AI remembers every interaction, so returning customers never repeat themselves.
> 3. **Automation layer**: The AI takes action—books appointments, updates your CRM, sends follow-ups.
> 
> Most companies sell you one layer. We integrate all three, so it actually works in production, not just as a demo."

---

### MINUTES 25-30: THE CLOSE (Next Steps)

**Transition:**
> "So, based on what you've heard—does this feel like something that would solve [their specific pain they mentioned earlier]?"

**If YES:**
> "Great. Here's what happens next:
> 
> 1. I'll send you a proposal today with pricing, timeline, and scope.
> 2. **Pricing is typically $2K-$4K for the build, then $500-$1,500/month for maintenance** depending on complexity.
> 3. **Timeline is 3-4 weeks from kickoff to go-live.**
> 4. If you like the proposal, we'll schedule a kickoff call to map out your workflow, and then we build.
> 
> Any questions before I send that over?"

**If NO / HESITANT:**
> "No worries. What's your biggest concern or hesitation right now?"

**Common objections:**
1. **"It's too expensive"** → "Compared to hiring someone? This is 1/4 the cost of a full-time person and works 24/7. What were you planning to spend on solving this?"
2. **"I need to think about it"** → "Totally fair. What specifically do you need to think through? Maybe I can send you some additional info that helps."
3. **"I want to try it for free first"** → "I get that. The challenge is every build is custom to your workflow and tools, so there's no 'trial' version. But we do have a 30-day money-back guarantee. If it doesn't work, we refund the setup fee."

---

### MINUTES 30-35: HANDLE OBJECTIONS (If They Come Up)

#### Objection 1: "This sounds like a chatbot. I've tried those and they don't work."

**Response:**
> "You're right—most chatbots don't work because they're just Layer 1 (voice) without Layer 2 (memory) or Layer 3 (automation). They can talk, but they forget who they talked to and can't take action. That's why they feel like demos.
> 
> What we build is different. The AI remembers every customer, learns from every conversation, and actually updates your CRM and calendar. That's the difference between a chatbot and a system."

---

#### Objection 2: "What if the AI gives wrong information to a customer?"

**Response:**
> "Great question. Here's how we handle that:
> 1. **Training phase**: We spend Week 1 learning your business, your FAQs, your edge cases. The AI only knows what we train it on.
> 2. **Testing phase**: Before it talks to real customers, we test it on 10-20 mock scenarios. You review every response.
> 3. **Guardrails**: We build in fallback logic. If the AI doesn't know something, it says 'Let me connect you to a human' instead of guessing.
> 4. **Monitoring**: We monitor every interaction for the first 2 weeks. If something breaks, we fix it same-day.
> 
> In 50+ systems we've built, we've never had a case where the AI embarrassed a client. It's designed to be cautious, not clever."

---

#### Objection 3: "I don't want to deal with maintaining this myself."

**Response:**
> "You don't. That's what the monthly maintenance covers. We monitor it, optimize it, fix bugs, and add updates. You literally don't touch it unless you want to change something. That's the whole point—it works without you."

---

#### Objection 4: "What if I want to cancel after 3 months?"

**Response:**
> "You can. No long-term contract. Monthly maintenance is month-to-month. If it's not working, you turn it off. But in practice, that never happens because once the AI is handling [200 calls / 50 tickets] per month, turning it off means you're back to doing that manually. The switching cost is high because it works."

---

#### Objection 5: "Can I just hire a VA for cheaper?"

**Response:**
> "You could. Here's the trade-off:
> - **VA**: $1,500-$2,000/month, works 40 hours/week, takes time off, needs training, quits after 6 months, can handle ~50-100 interactions/week.
> - **AI system**: $500-$1,500/month, works 24/7, never quits, remembers everything forever, can handle 500+ interactions/week.
> 
> If your volume is low (under 50/week), a VA makes sense. If your volume is high or you need 24/7 coverage, the AI is cheaper and more reliable. Which one fits your situation better?"
