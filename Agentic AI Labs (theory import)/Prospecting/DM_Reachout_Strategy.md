================================================================
1. CORE PHILOSOPHY
================================================================

Rockefeller's approach to competitors was never "buy or die." It was:

  "Let us look at the facts together. We think it is to your interest
  and to ours to work together. Do not be in a hurry. Think it over.
  Take your time."

Then he'd open his books. Prospects came away astonished at the profits.

Our reachout works the same way. We never cold pitch. We warm the ground, build visibility, demonstrate value, and then — when the moment is right — we have a conversation between equals. Builder to builder.


================================================================
2. THE THREE RULES OF EVERY DM
================================================================

  Rule 1: Never send a DM to a stranger
    Rockefeller Principle: "Trapped the prey before it knew the seduction had begun"
    What It Means: You must have 2-3 visible touchpoints before any DM. Comments on their posts, genuine engagement, shared content. They should recognize your name.

  Rule 2: The DM is a question, never a pitch
    Rockefeller Principle: "Let us look at the facts together"
    What It Means: Your first DM asks a genuine question about THEIR business. It opens a conversation. It does not describe YOUR services.

  Rule 3: Patience first, decisive action when ready
    Rockefeller Principle: "Nothing, nothing, nothing... then act on a grand scale"
    What It Means: 2-3 weeks of engagement before DM. But when they respond with interest — proposal same day, call within 48 hours. Slow warm-up. Fast close.


================================================================
3. THE 5 REACHOUT PLAYBOOKS
================================================================

Each playbook is a different channel with a different target.
Same philosophy, different execution.


----------------------------------------------------------------
3a. PLAYBOOK 1: LINKEDIN — RECENTLY FUNDED FOUNDERS
----------------------------------------------------------------

Target: Non-technical founders who just announced Seed / Series A
Volume: 5 new founders per week
Timeline: 2-3 week warm-up per founder


WEEK 1 — RECONNAISSANCE
(Rockefeller: "The good ones know more")

  - Find the founder's announcement post (raise, milestone, launch)
  - Read their LinkedIn profile, company website, recent posts
  - Understand: What do they sell? What stage? What's their ops pain likely to be?
  - Leave a genuine, thoughtful comment on their announcement. Not "congrats!" — something specific:

    "The timing on this makes sense. [Industry] is ripe for someone who
    actually [thing they do]. Curious what the first hire post-raise
    looks like for you."

  - Like/react to 2-3 of their other posts


WEEK 2 — VISIBILITY
(Rockefeller: "Travel to the oil regions, collect information")

  - Comment on 2-3 more posts. Add value. Share a perspective. Disagree respectfully on something.
  - If they post about operations, scaling, hiring, or AI — leave a comment that reveals YOUR expertise without pitching:

    "We saw this exact thing with a founder last month. They were spending
    6 hours/day on support calls before they realized the problem wasn't
    headcount — it was that nobody was building systems for the
    repetitive 80%."

  - By now, they've seen your name 4-6 times. You're familiar.


WEEK 3 — THE DM
(Rockefeller: "Do not be in a hurry. Think it over.")

  DM Template:

    Hey [Name],

    Been following your journey since the [raise/launch/milestone].
    What you're building in [their space] is sharp.

    Curious — as you scale post-raise, are you building your
    AI/automation layer in-house or looking to work with someone
    on that?

    No pitch. Genuinely curious how founders at your stage are
    thinking about it.

  Why this works:
    - It's a question, not a pitch
    - It references THEIR milestone (you've been paying attention)
    - "No pitch" disarms immediately
    - It opens a conversation they actually want to have


IF THEY RESPOND WITH INTEREST:

  - Move fast. Same-day response.
  - Share ONE specific, relevant example:
    "We built a system for a [similar industry] founder that handles
    [specific task]. Happy to show you a 2-minute demo if it's relevant."
  - Link to the live demo number or a Loom
  - Propose a 15-minute call:
    "Not a sales call — just curious if what we build is even relevant
    to what you're doing. 15 minutes max."


IF THEY DON'T RESPOND:

  - Do nothing for 7 days.
  - Continue engaging with their content.
  - After 7-14 days, try ONE more touchpoint — a relevant piece of content sent as a DM:
    "Saw this and thought of what you're building — [link to your own
    'tools vs systems' post or a relevant case study]. No response
    needed, just thought it was relevant."
  - If no response again: move on. They're not ready. They may come back later.


----------------------------------------------------------------
3b. PLAYBOOK 2: GHL COMMUNITY — AGENCY OWNERS
----------------------------------------------------------------

Target: GHL agency owners who sell "AI services" but can't build
Volume: 3-5 agency owners per month
Timeline: 2-3 week warm-up, then partnership DM


WEEKS 1-2 — BE THE EXPERT
(Rockefeller: Refiners Association — information gathering)

  - Join top GHL Facebook groups. Observe. Learn their language.
  - Answer 3-5 questions per week about AI, voice agents, or GHL automation.
  - Share short, valuable content:

    "Just connected a voice agent to a GHL workflow for a dental client.
    It handles appointment booking, updates the contact record, and
    triggers the follow-up sequence. Here's a 60-second walkthrough."

  - Key insight from Rockefeller: The Refiners Association wasn't about
    cooperation. It was about seeing everyone's books. Your GHL
    participation isn't just about helping — it's about understanding
    which agencies are selling AI, which ones can't deliver, and which
    ones are perfect partnership candidates.


WEEK 3 — THE DM

  DM Template:

    Hey [Name],

    I've been seeing your posts about offering AI to your clients —
    looks like you're ahead of most agencies on this.

    Quick question: are you building the AI layer yourself or working
    with a technical team for that?

    We're a 3-person AI systems studio. We build the voice + memory +
    automation stack for agencies who want to offer AI without building
    it in-house. White-labeled under your brand.

    Would you be open to seeing a quick demo of what the system
    looks like?

  Why this works:
    - Compliment that's specific (you've seen their posts)
    - The question probes their pain (they're probably struggling to deliver)
    - Immediate positioning: you're not a competitor, you're their backend
    - "White-labeled under your brand" is the magic phrase


THE PARTNERSHIP PITCH (ON THE CALL):

  "Here's how it works. You sell the AI service to your client. We build
  it. You charge retail, you pay us wholesale. Your client never knows
  we exist. You look like a genius."

  - Show the live demo. Let them call the AI phone number.
  - Propose a pilot:
    "Let's do one project together. If it works, we make it ongoing.
    Zero risk."


----------------------------------------------------------------
3c. PLAYBOOK 3: N8N / ELEVENLABS / MAKE.COM — DIY BUILDERS WHO HIT THE WALL
----------------------------------------------------------------

Target: Developers/founders who are actively struggling with production AI in community forums
Volume: Ongoing — reactive to their posts
Timeline: Immediate value, long-tail DMs


THIS IS NOT A SEQUENCE. THIS IS A SIGNAL-BASED SYSTEM.

Monitor these communities for specific signals:
  - "How do I make my AI agent remember previous conversations?"
  - "Voice agent works in testing but fails with real calls"
  - "n8n workflow breaking with concurrent requests"
  - "How do I connect ElevenLabs to my CRM?"


Step 1: Give the best answer in the thread.
  Not a vague pointer. A detailed, specific, useful answer.
  Architecture diagram if needed. Code snippet if relevant.
  The kind of answer that makes everyone in the thread save it.

Step 2: Let your profile do the selling.
  - LinkedIn link in profile
  - One-liner in bio: "Build production AI systems (voice + memory + automation) at Agentic AI Labs"
  - Website link

Step 3: When someone DMs YOU (and they will):

    "Thanks for reaching out. Happy to dig deeper on [their specific
    problem].

    Quick context: we run an AI systems studio — we build
    production-grade voice + memory + automation systems for founders.
    If your challenge is something that can be solved with a quick tip,
    I'll give it to you free. If it's a bigger build, I can show you
    how we'd approach it.

    What's the full picture of what you're trying to build?"

  Rockefeller parallel: This is the equivalent of being the only refiner
  who actually understood the full supply chain. Everyone else was
  guessing. You're the person who's actually done it in production.
  The expertise sells itself.


----------------------------------------------------------------
3d. PLAYBOOK 4: FRACTIONAL CTO PARTNERSHIPS
----------------------------------------------------------------

Target: Fractional CTOs who advise 1-10 stage founders
Volume: 10 identified, 5 messaged, 2 closed — within 60 days
Timeline: Single DM (these are B2B professionals, not cold consumers)


THE DM:

    Hey [Name],

    I run Agentic AI Labs — a 3-person AI systems studio. We build
    production-grade AI for founders: voice agents, memory systems, and
    workflow automation, all integrated.

    I'm looking for 2-3 fractional CTOs to partner with. The setup is
    simple: when your clients need AI built, you refer them to us.
    We build. You advise. We pay you 10-15% on every referred project.

    I'd be happy to show you a live demo of a system we built — you
    can literally call a phone number and talk to the AI.

    Would a 15-minute intro call make sense?

  Why this works:
    - Direct. No fluff. B2B professionals respect brevity.
    - The value prop is crystal clear: you make money for introducing people.
    - The live demo offer eliminates skepticism.
    - 15-minute ask is low-commitment.

  Rockefeller parallel: "Buy connected people for their connections."
  Rockefeller paid $400K for a $250K company because the owner had
  political connections. You're paying 10-15% for access to their
  network. The referral fee IS the cap-table-as-weapon strategy.


----------------------------------------------------------------
3e. PLAYBOOK 5: VC / ANGEL INVESTOR RELATIONSHIPS
----------------------------------------------------------------

Target: VCs who invest in Seed / Series A — their portfolio companies need AI
Volume: 2-3 VCs targeted over 6 months
Timeline: Longest play. 3-6 month warm-up. No rushing.


MONTHS 1-2 — SILENT INTELLIGENCE GATHERING

  - Identify 5 VCs who invest in your ICP's stage and industry
  - Follow them. Study their portfolio companies.
  - Engage with their content: thoughtful comments, not "great post"
  - Engage with their portfolio companies' content too — congratulate launches, comment on milestones


MONTHS 2-3 — BECOME VISIBLE

  - Your own content should start appearing in their feed (LinkedIn algorithm)
  - Comment on their portfolio company posts with genuine AI insights
  - Share content that's relevant to their thesis


MONTHS 3-4 — THE WARM INTRO ATTEMPT

  - Find a mutual connection or a portfolio company you can approach directly
  - Offer to build something for one portfolio company at a discount — as a proof case

  The DM (to the VC):

    Hey [Name],

    I've been following [Portfolio Company X]'s growth — really sharp product.

    My team builds AI systems for scaling founders (voice agents + memory
    + automation — all integrated). I'd love to offer [Portfolio Company X]
    a discounted pilot as a proof case.

    If it works, happy to be a resource for other portfolio companies.
    No obligation.

    Worth a quick intro?

  Rockefeller parallel: "Infinitely patient. Nothing, nothing, nothing...
  then act on a grand scale." One VC relationship = access to 10-30
  portfolio companies. This is the longest play but the highest leverage.


================================================================
4. ANTI-PATTERNS (WHAT WE NEVER DO IN DMs)
================================================================

  Never: Send a pitch as the first message
  Why: You're a stranger. Strangers who pitch get ignored.
  Instead: Warm up for 2-3 weeks. First DM is a question.

  Never: Use "we leverage cutting-edge AI solutions"
  Why: Corporate jargon. Kills trust instantly.
  Instead: "We build AI systems. They talk to your customers, remember everything, and take action."

  Never: Send the same template to everyone
  Why: People can smell copy-paste. It signals you don't care about THEM.
  Instead: Reference something specific about their business, post, or situation.

  Never: Follow up more than twice
  Why: Desperation repels.
  Instead: Two touches max. If no response, move on. Let your content bring them back.

  Never: Pitch in public comments
  Why: It makes you look like every other spammy agency.
  Instead: Comments educate and provoke. DMs converse. Never cross the streams.

  Never: Talk about your tech stack
  Why: Nobody cares about ElevenLabs or Mem0 in a first DM.
  Instead: Talk about their business outcome. Tech is implementation detail.

  Never: Say "I'd love to help you"
  Why: Patronizing. Implies they need help.
  Instead: "Curious how you're thinking about [X]" — makes them the expert.

================================================================
7. ROCKEFELLER REACHOUT PRINCIPLES — SUMMARY
================================================================

  1. "The good ones know more"
     Research every prospect deeply before any contact. Know their business,
     their stage, their pain. Show it in your message.

  2. "Trapped the prey before the seduction had begun"
     2-3 weeks of genuine engagement before any DM. They should already
     respect you before you message them.

  3. "Do not be in a hurry. Think it over. Take your time."
     The first DM is a question. Never a pitch. Let them come to the
     conclusion themselves.

  4. "Open his books — prospects came away astonished"
     Your proof is the live demo. Let them call the AI. Let the system
     sell itself. Point, don't talk.

  5. "Patience + decisive action"
     Weeks of patience in the warm-up. But when they say "I'm interested"
     — proposal same day. Call within 48 hours. Speed in the close.

  6. "Buy connected people for their connections"
     The 5 relationships (2 fractional CTOs, 2 GHL agencies, 1 VC)
     replace 50 cold DMs. Invest in multiplier relationships.

  7. "Components are commodities. The integrated system is the monopoly."
     Every DM should reinforce: tools are cheap, systems are rare.
     You're the system builder.


================================================================
8. THE PITCH REFRAME: AI ROLES, NOT AI SYSTEMS
================================================================

THE CORE INSIGHT: POSITIONING vs PITCH

Your POSITIONING and your PITCH are two different things:

  Positioning:
    Audience: The market (everyone)
    Purpose: Category creation — "we're the AI systems company"
    Level: Abstract, philosophical
    Lives in: Your LinkedIn bio, website, brand

  Pitch:
    Audience: One specific prospect
    Purpose: Get THIS person to say "tell me more"
    Level: Concrete, tangible, outcome-specific
    Lives in: Your DM, your first call, your proposal


THE ROCKEFELLER ANSWER

Rockefeller didn't walk into a room and say "I sell an integrated oil system."

He sold kerosene. Cheap, reliable kerosene that lights your house.

Behind the kerosene was the refinery, the railroad rebates, the pipeline
network, the barrel factory, the distribution fleet. The customer never
bought "the system." The customer bought the kerosene. The system was
what made the kerosene cheaper, more reliable, and impossible to compete with.

Your kerosene is the voice agent. But not a naked voice agent. A voice agent
that clearly does something the standalone ones can't.


THE VOICE AGENT IS NOT THE PITCH EITHER

The pitch isn't "voice agent" and it isn't "voice agent + CRM."
The pitch is the business outcome that the connected system produces.

  What you could say:
    "We build AI voice agents"
    What the founder hears: "So does everyone. Next."

  What you could say:
    "We build AI voice agents connected to your CRM"
    What the founder hears: "Okay, interesting, but I can probably Zapier that together"

  What you could say:
    "We build an AI that picks up every call, books the appointment,
    updates your CRM, and sends the follow-up — without you hiring anyone"
    What the founder hears: "Wait, tell me more."

The third one is the pitch. It's not about the components. It's about the
chain of actions that replaces a human workflow.


THE "AI [ROLE]" FRAMEWORK

Instead of pitching technology or architecture, pitch an AI role:

  "We build your AI ________."
                     [ROLE]

  Domain              | The AI Role              | What it actually is
  --------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------
  Dental/Clinics      | AI Receptionist          | Voice agent + calendar booking + patient memory + follow-up automation
  Recruiting          | AI Interviewer           | Voice agent + scoring criteria + candidate memory + ATS pipeline automation
  Agencies            | AI SDR                   | Voice agent + lead qualification + CRM updates + meeting booking
  E-commerce          | AI Support Rep           | Chat/voice agent + order history memory + returns automation
  Real Estate         | AI Showing Coordinator   | Voice agent + listing knowledge + scheduling + CRM sync
  Fitness/Gyms        | AI Membership Advisor    | Voice agent + member history + booking + re-engagement

The role is the pitch. The system is the delivery.

When you say "AI Receptionist," the dental practice owner instantly
understands what it does, who it replaces, and why they need it.
When you say "AI system," they nod politely and move on.


================================================================
9. DOMAIN-SPECIFIC PITCH PLAYBOOKS
================================================================

FOR DENTAL PRACTICES / CLINICS:

  "We build an AI receptionist that answers every call, books appointments
  into your calendar, remembers returning patients, and sends
  confirmations — 24/7, no missed calls."


FOR RECRUITING / HR:

  "We build an AI interviewer that conducts first-round voice screenings,
  scores candidates on your criteria, and pushes qualified ones into your
  pipeline — so your team only talks to people worth talking to."


FOR MARKETING AGENCIES (GHL):

  "We build an AI SDR for your clients — it calls leads, qualifies them,
  books meetings on the sales rep's calendar, and updates the CRM.
  White-labeled under your brand."


FOR E-COMMERCE:

  "We build an AI support agent that handles returns, order status, and
  product questions — and actually remembers each customer's history so
  they never repeat themselves."


Notice: every single one of these is the same system (voice + memory +
automation). But none of them say "AI system." They describe a role the
AI plays in that specific business.


================================================================
10. HOW THIS MAPS TO VERBAL IDENTITY
================================================================

Your Verbal Identity doc doesn't need to change. It just operates at
a different altitude:

  BRAND LEVEL (LinkedIn bio, website, content):
    "We build AI systems that run parts of your business."
    → This is your POSITIONING. It's the umbrella.

  PITCH LEVEL (DMs, first calls, proposals):
    "We build your AI Receptionist / AI Interviewer / AI SDR."
    → This is your ENTRY POINT. It's the kerosene.

  DELIVERY LEVEL (after they sign):
    Voice + Memory + Automation, integrated.
    → This is your SYSTEM. It's what makes the role actually work.

  LOCK-IN LEVEL (month 2+):
    "Your AI now remembers every patient/candidate/lead.
     It gets smarter every month."
    → This is your MOAT. It's what prevents switching.

The positioning says "we're the AI systems company."
The pitch says "we'll build your AI [Role]."
The delivery proves the positioning was true.


================================================================

The goal is not 50 DMs per week. The goal is 5 conversations per week
with the right people, warmed up properly, at the right moment.
Quality of targeting > volume of outreach. Every single time.

================================================================
