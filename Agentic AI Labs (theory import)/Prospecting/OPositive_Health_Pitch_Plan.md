# O'POSITIVE HEALTH — AI CALLING SYSTEM PITCH PLAN
**Lead: O'Positive Health (opositivehealth.com)**  
**AI Role: AI Patient Outreach Coordinator**  
**Date: 2026-02-21**  
**Owner: Aditya, Agentic AI Labs**

## ⚡ ELEVATOR PITCH (60-Second Version)

### Context

O'Positive Health is India's hospital-agnostic surgical platform — they coordinate surgeries across 100+ hospitals and 500+ doctors for patients nationwide. They've treated 1,000+ patients across 30+ conditions (cataract, knee replacement, piles, kidney stone, etc.). Their revenue model runs on converting consultations into booked surgeries.

They have **1,000-2,000 past patients** sitting in their database who consulted but never got surgery. Right now, **10 employees** make 50-100 calls each per day to re-engage these patients and determine surgery intent.

They're actively looking for an AI calling system. This is not exploratory — they've already benchmarked per-minute costs ($0.12-$0.20/min) and want CRM integration via APIs.

### Problem

Their team of 10 maxes out at ~750 calls/day. Covering 2,000 patients takes 2-3 weeks with follow-ups, re-calls, and manual CRM updates. By the time they reach Patient #1,500, Patient #1 has gone cold — or gone to a competitor.

Meanwhile, every uncalled patient who was ready for surgery is **₹50,000 to ₹5,00,000 in lost revenue** walking out the door.

Hiring 10 more employees doubles the salary bill to ₹5L/month, adds management overhead, and still doesn't solve the speed problem. Call center attrition in India runs 30-40% annually. Manual data entry into the CRM is inconsistent. Quality varies from caller to caller.

**The bottleneck isn't effort. It's physics.** 10 humans cannot cover 2,000 patients fast enough, consistently enough, at the data quality required.

### Solution

We build an **AI Patient Outreach Coordinator** that:

1. **Calls 2,000 patients in 2-3 days** (not 2-3 weeks)
2. **Speaks Hindi and English naturally** — real conversation, not IVR
3. **Asks about their surgery intent** — "How are you feeling? Have you thought about the procedure?"
4. **Classifies every patient** — Ready for surgery / Needs follow-up / Not interested / Callback later
5. **Updates the CRM automatically** — every call logged, tagged, scored. Zero manual entry.
6. **Triggers the right next step** — assigns care coordinator, sends WhatsApp info, schedules callback
7. **Delivers a daily dashboard** to the COO — calls made, intent breakdown, conversion pipeline

**One number**: If this system recovers just 10 additional surgery conversions per month, that's **₹3,00,000+/month in recovered revenue** — the system pays for itself on Day 1.

> **The one-liner**: "We build an AI that calls your 2,000 past patients, identifies who's ready for surgery, and updates your CRM — in days, not weeks."

## 1. LEAD INTELLIGENCE BRIEF

### Who They Are

**O'Positive Health** is India's hospital-agnostic surgical platform. They sit between the patient and the hospital — they don't perform surgeries, they coordinate them.

**Key Facts:**
- **Business Model**: Surgical aggregator / patient coordination platform
- **Network**: 100+ hospitals, 500+ doctors across India
- **Patients**: 1,000+ treated
- **Team**: ~10 employees (with 10 employees currently making calls)
- **Specialties**: Cataract, LASIK, Kidney Stone, Piles, Hernia, Knee/Hip Replacement, Gallstone, Varicose Veins, Lipoma, and 30+ other conditions
- **Insurance**: All major TPAs, 25+ insurance companies, CGHS/ECHS/Govt panels
- **Leadership**: 3 Co-founders (Akshay Bhatia, Yogesh Prajapati, Dr. Vaibhav Bhatia) + COO (Prateek Shukla) + Founding Member (Manish Chauhan)
- **Location**: Delhi-NCR based (hospitals in Delhi primarily)
- **Contact**: 24/7 helpline on WhatsApp (+91 84485 34103)
- **Website**: Built by Createsoftware.in

### What They Want

**AI Calling System to automate outreach to 1,000-2,000 past patients.**

The specific intent: Determine which past patients are ready for surgery (or need follow-up), re-engage dormant patients, and convert consultations to booked surgeries.

### Their Current Pain (In Their Words)

- 10 employees making 50-100 calls daily (that's 500-1,000 calls/day total — but still not enough to cover 1,000-2,000 past patients efficiently)
- They're **motivated to switch to AI** — this isn't exploratory, this is active intent
- They've already articulated the integration need (CRM via APIs)
- They've already benchmarked cost ($0.12-$0.20/minute)

### What This Tells Us

This is a **highly qualified lead**. They've self-diagnosed the problem, researched the cost structure, and are actively seeking a solution. They're past the "should we do this?" stage. They're at "who do we do this with?"

## 2. ICP FIT ANALYSIS

### Fit Score: ★★★★☆ (Strong Fit — with adjustments)

| Criteria | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| High-volume interactions | ✅ | 500-1,000 calls/day across team; 1,000-2,000 patient re-engagement target |
| Manual operational bottleneck | ✅ | 10 employees dedicated to phone calling |
| Budget authority | ✅ | Leadership team is decision-making body; already researched per-minute pricing |
| Timeline urgency | ✅ | Actively looking — motivated to switch |
| Tried other solutions | ⚠️ | Using manual labor (10 employees); need to probe if they've tried any AI/IVR |
| Geography | ⚠️ | India (not US/UK) — adjust pricing model accordingly |

### Adjustments Required from Standard ICP

1. **Indian market pricing**: Their cost benchmark ($0.12-$0.20/min) is India-market. Our standard US pricing ($2K-$4K setup + $500-$1,500/month) needs recalibration for Indian healthcare economics.

2. **Language**: Outbound calling will need Hindi + English (and possibly regional language support). Voice AI must handle bilingual conversations naturally.

3. **CRM Integration**: They likely use a custom CRM or a healthcare-specific tool (not Salesforce/HubSpot). API integration scope needs discovery.

4. **Outbound, not inbound**: This is NOT an AI Receptionist use case (our standard clinic pitch). This is **outbound patient re-engagement** — a different workflow. The AI is calling the patient, not the other way around.

5. **Compliance**: Indian healthcare regulations (TRAI calling regulations, patient data privacy under the Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023) must be considered.

---

## 3. THE NARRATIVE ARC (CUSTOMIZED FOR O'POSITIVE)

Using the Sales Narrative Arc framework, here's the full arc rendered for this lead:

### 1. THE PROBLEM

**In their language:**

> You have 1,000-2,000 past patients sitting in your database. Every day that passes, their intent cools. Some of them are ready for surgery. Some need a follow-up. Some have gone to a competitor. You don't know which is which — because your 10 employees can only make 50-100 calls each per day, and even at full capacity, they can't cover the entire patient base in under a month.

> By the time your team reaches Patient #1,500, Patient #1 has already forgotten you called three weeks ago.

**The Test**: When you say this to O'Positive's founders, they should immediately say "yes, that's exactly our problem."

### 2. THE STAKEHOLDER

- **Primary**: Akshay Bhatia / Yogesh Prajapati (Co-founders — budget + strategic authority)
- **Operational Champion**: Prateek Shukla (COO — manages the calling team, understands the daily pain)
- **Technical**: Whoever manages their CRM (likely an internal tech person or outsourced to Createsoftware.in)

**Key insight**: The COO is your operational champion. The founders approve the budget. The pitch must satisfy both — operational efficiency for the COO, strategic ROI for the founders.

### 3. THE COST (Quantify It)

**Hard Numbers:**

| Cost Item | Current (Manual) | With AI System |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| 10 calling employees | ₹15,000-₹25,000/month each = **₹1.5L-2.5L/month** | System replaces 7-8 of them on outbound |
| Calls per day (team) | 500-1,000 calls | 2,000-5,000 calls (AI never stops) |
| Time to cover 2,000 patients | 3-4 weeks | **2-3 days** |
| Consistency | Varies (mood, skill, fatigue) | Same quality on call 1 and call 2,000 |
| Working hours | 8 hours/day, 6 days/week | 24/7 (within TRAI compliant hours) |
| Data capture | Manual CRM entry (inconsistent) | Automatic — every call logged, tagged, scored |

**Opportunity Cost:**
- Every patient who was ready for surgery but wasn't called in time = **₹50,000-₹5,00,000 in lost surgery revenue** (depending on the procedure)
- A Cataract surgery packages for ₹25,000-₹50,000. A Knee Replacement for ₹2,00,000-₹5,00,000.
- If AI reaches just **50 additional surgery-ready patients per month** that the manual team would have missed = **₹25L-₹2.5Cr per month in recovered revenue**.

**The ROI math writes itself.** The AI system pays for itself on the first converted surgery.

### 4. THE STATUS QUO (What They're Doing Now)

**Manual calling with 10 employees:**
- Expensive (₹1.5L-2.5L/month in salaries alone)
- Slow (can't cover full database in time)
- Inconsistent (Employee A doesn't ask the same questions as Employee B)
- No memory (if Patient calls back, a different employee picks up — no context)
- Poor data capture (manual CRM updates are unreliable)
- High attrition (calling jobs in India have 30-40% annual turnover)
- Can't scale — adding 10 more employees doubles cost and management burden

**Why it fails**: The volume is too high and the timeline too short for humans to handle efficiently. They've already acknowledged this — they're "motivated to switch."

### 5. THE CHANGE (Why Now)

**Two shifts make this possible today:**

1. **Voice AI crossed the Hindi/English bilingual threshold** (2024-2025)
   - Indian-accent voice models from ElevenLabs/Smallest AI now handle conversational Hindi-English code-switching naturally
   - Latency below 1 second even on Indian telecom infrastructure
   - 95%+ accuracy in intent classification for structured conversations

2. **US clinic validation proves the model**
   - AI calling for patient re-engagement is already proven in US healthcare (their own market validation confirms this)
   - The India adaptation is about language and pricing, not proving the concept

**The "why us" angle**: We've built voice + memory + automation systems. We don't just build a voice agent that calls. We build a system that calls, remembers the patient's history, classifies their intent, updates the CRM, and triggers the right follow-up — all without human intervention.

### 6. THE SOLUTION

**We build an AI Patient Outreach Coordinator for O'Positive Health.**

What it does (the action chain):

1. **Pulls patient data from CRM** — name, condition, last visit, surgery status
2. **Calls the patient** in Hindi/English (natural, conversational voice)
3. **Runs a structured conversation** — "How are you feeling? Have you thought about the surgery? Do you have any questions?"
4. **Classifies intent**: Ready for surgery / Needs more info / Not interested / Wrong number / Callback later
5. **Updates CRM automatically** — tags the patient, logs the conversation, scores intent
6. **Triggers next action**:
   - "Ready for surgery" → Auto-assigns care coordinator + sends appointment booking link
   - "Needs more info" → Schedules doctor callback + sends WhatsApp info package
   - "Not interested" → Tags for future campaign (3 months)
   - "Callback later" → Schedules callback at patient's preferred time
7. **Sends summary dashboard** to COO daily — calls made, intent breakdown, conversions

**The Three Layers (Internal, Not Pitched to Client):**

| Layer | What It Does for O'Positive |
|-------|---------------------------|
| **Voice (Layer 1)** | AI calls patients, handles bilingual conversation, sounds natural |
| **Memory (Layer 2)** | Remembers each patient's condition, history, past interactions; if patient calls back, AI knows who they are |
| **Automation (Layer 3)** | Updates CRM, assigns coordinators, triggers WhatsApp messages, generates reports |

### 7. THE PROOF

**Proof we should lead with:**

1. **Live Demo**: Build a demo that simulates an outbound call to a past cataract patient. Let O'Positive's team call the number and experience the AI.

2. **Specific Numbers** (from similar deployments):
   > "We built this for a clinic. The AI made 300 calls in the first week. 47 appointments booked. 0 human intervention."

3. **Before/After**:
   - **Before**: 10 humans, 8 hours/day, 500-1,000 calls/day, 3-4 weeks to cover 2,000 patients
   - **After**: 1 AI system, compliant calling hours, 2,000 calls/day, full database covered in 2-3 days

4. **Process Transparency**: Show the build timeline (Section 12)

5. **Market Validation**: Similar AI calling systems already proven in US clinics — their own reference point supports this

---

## 4. THE AI ROLE DEFINITION

### Role: AI Patient Outreach Coordinator

**The Pitch (one sentence):**

> "We build an AI Patient Outreach Coordinator that calls your 2,000 past patients, identifies who's ready for surgery, updates your CRM, and assigns the right follow-up — in days, not weeks."

**Why "Patient Outreach Coordinator" (not "AI Caller"):**

Per our AI Role framework:
- Name it after the **human role it replaces** → "Patient Outreach Coordinator" (the humans doing outbound calling today)
- The pitch describes the **full action chain** → calls + classifies intent + updates CRM + triggers follow-up
- Immediately understood by a non-technical founder → "Outreach Coordinator" is a role they already have

**What It Actually Is (internal):**

Voice agent (ElevenLabs/Smallest AI for bilingual voice) + Patient memory (conditions, history, past visits) + Workflow automation (CRM update, care coordinator assignment, WhatsApp triggers, reporting dashboard)

---

## 5. DISCOVERY CALL STRATEGY

### Pre-Call Intel (Already Known)

We already know more than usual because they've articulated their requirements:
- ✅ Volume: 1,000-2,000 patients
- ✅ Pain: 10 employees at capacity
- ✅ Budget awareness: $0.12-$0.20/min benchmarked
- ✅ Integration need: CRM via APIs
- ✅ Market validation: US clinic references

### What We Still Need to Learn

**Discovery Questions (customized):**

1. **CRM Question**: "What CRM are you using to manage patient data? Is it a custom-built system, or something off-the-shelf like Salesforce or Zoho?"
   - *Why*: Determines integration complexity and cost

2. **Data Quality Question**: "For these 1,000-2,000 past patients — how clean is the data? Do you have phone numbers, condition types, and last visit dates for all of them?"
   - *Why*: AI calling is only as good as the data. Garbage in = garbage out.

3. **Conversation Flow Question**: "Walk me through what your employees say on a typical outreach call. Is there a script? What are the 3-4 key questions you ask?"
   - *Why*: We need to understand the decision tree for the AI's conversation flow

4. **Language Question**: "What percentage of your patients prefer Hindi vs. English? Are there other regional languages we'd need?"
   - *Why*: Determines voice model requirements and complexity

5. **Compliance Question**: "Are you registered under TRAI's regulations for outbound calling? Do you have DND scrubbing in place?"
   - *Why*: Outbound calling in India is regulated. The AI system must comply with TRAI's calling hours (9 AM - 9 PM), DND registry, and frequency limits.

6. **Success Metric Question**: "If this works perfectly, what does success look like for you in Month 1? Is it a specific number of surgeries booked? A specific conversion rate?"
   - *Why*: Anchors the ROI narrative and defines what "working" means

7. **Decision-Maker Question**: "Who else needs to sign off on this — is it just you and the co-founders, or is there a technical team involved?"
   - *Why*: Identifies the buying committee

8. **Timeline Question**: "How soon do you want this live?"
   - *Why*: Urgency = speed of close

### Call Structure (Modified from Standard Script)

**Minutes 0-3: Opener**
> "Thanks for jumping on. I've already looked into your platform and your patient coordination model — really sharp setup. Here's how I'd like to use the next 25 minutes:
> 
> First 10 minutes — I'll ask some questions to understand how your outreach works today and where the bottleneck is.
> 
> Next 10 minutes — I'll show you a working demo of an AI system we built that does exactly this — outbound patient calling, intent classification, CRM updates. You can actually call a number and talk to the AI.
> 
> Last 5 minutes — we'll figure out if there's a fit. If yes, I'll send a proposal today. If not, I'll tell you honestly.
> 
> Sound good?"

**Minutes 3-12: Discovery** (use the questions above)

**Minutes 12-22: Demo**
> "Based on what you've described — 2,000 patients, outbound calls, figuring out who's ready for surgery — this is exactly what we build. Let me show you.
> 
> This is an AI Patient Outreach Coordinator we built. It calls a patient, has a natural conversation in Hindi/English, asks about their condition, classifies their intent — ready for surgery, needs more info, not interested — and then updates the CRM and triggers the right follow-up.
> 
> Want to hear it? Call this number."

**Minutes 22-27: Close** (see Section 9 for pricing)

## 6. THE PITCH (Copy-Ready Versions)

### Version 1: The DM Pitch (LinkedIn/WhatsApp — 60 words)

> You have 2,000 past patients in your database. Your team of 10 can call maybe 500-1,000 a day. By the time they reach the last patient, the first ones have gone cold.
> 
> We build an AI that calls all 2,000 in 2-3 days, identifies who's ready for surgery, and updates your CRM — without you hiring anyone.
> 
> Worth a 15-minute call?

### Version 2: The Email Pitch (100 words)

**Subject: Re-engaging 2,000 patients in 2 days (not 3 weeks)**

> Hi [Name],
> 
> I came across O'Positive Health and noticed your team is looking at AI calling to re-engage past patients for surgery conversion.
> 
> We build AI systems that do exactly this — outbound patient calls, bilingual (Hindi/English), with intent classification and CRM integration. The AI identifies who's ready for surgery, who needs follow-up, and who's not interested — in days, not weeks.
> 
> We built this for a clinic that was in the same spot. Their AI handled 300 calls in Week 1. 47 appointments. Zero human intervention.
> 
> Want me to show you a 5-minute demo?
> 
> — Aditya, Agentic AI Labs

### Version 3: The One-Liner (For Internal Use / Quick Pitch)

> "We build an AI Patient Outreach Coordinator that calls your past patients, determines who's ready for surgery, and updates your CRM — in days, not weeks."

### Version 4: The PAS Framework Pitch (For Presentation Slide / Longer Format)

**Problem:**
> You have 1,000-2,000 past patients who consulted but never got surgery. Every day they sit uncalled, their intent drops. Your 10 employees make 50-100 calls each — but by the time they reach the last patient, the first ones have moved on. Meanwhile, each unconverted cataract patient is ₹50,000 in lost revenue. Each unconverted knee replacement is ₹3,00,000.

**Agitate:**
> Hiring 10 more employees doubles your cost to ₹5L/month and creates a management nightmare. Training takes 2-3 weeks. Attrition in Indian call centers runs 30-40% annually. And even at double capacity, the coverage is still too slow — patients don't wait.

**Solution:**
> We build an AI Patient Outreach Coordinator that calls 2,000 patients in 2-3 days. It speaks Hindi and English naturally. It asks about the patient's condition, determines their surgery intent, classifies them into categories (Ready / Follow-up / Not Interested), updates your CRM automatically, and triggers the right next step — care coordinator assignment, WhatsApp info, or scheduled callback. Your team focuses on the 20% who are ready. The AI handles the 80% that's currently eating your team's time.

## 7. ROI QUANTIFICATION

### The Math That Closes the Deal

**Current State:**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Calling employees | 10 |
| Avg salary per employee | ₹20,000/month |
| Total monthly salary cost | ₹2,00,000/month |
| Calls per employee per day | 75 (avg of 50-100) |
| Total calls per day | 750 |
| Working days/month | 25 |
| Time to cover 2,000 patients | ~3 days (but with follow-ups, verification, re-calls → realistically 2-3 weeks) |
| Conversion rate (manual) | ~5-8% (industry standard for cold outbound patient re-engagement) |
| Surgeries converted/month (est.) | 50-160 patients |

**With AI System:**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Calls per day | 2,000-5,000 |
| Time to cover 2,000 patients | 1-2 days |
| Follow-up recycles | Automatic — AI re-calls "callback later" patients without human scheduling |
| Conversion rate (with speed advantage) | 8-12% (faster contact = higher intent capture) |
| Additional surgeries converted/month (est.) | 30-80 more than manual |
| Data quality | 100% logged, tagged, scored — vs. inconsistent manual entry |

**Revenue Impact:**
- Average surgery value on the platform: ₹50,000-₹3,00,000
- O'Positive's cut (commission): ~15-25% (estimated platform fee)
- 30 additional conversions × ₹1,50,000 avg value × 20% platform fee = **₹9,00,000/month in recovered revenue**
- Conservative estimate: Even at 10 additional conversions = **₹3,00,000/month**

**Cost of AI System (Proposed):**
- Setup: ₹2,00,000-₹3,50,000 (one-time)
- Monthly: Per-minute calling cost + maintenance = ₹50,000-₹1,00,000/month

**Net ROI**: AI system pays for itself within the first 1-2 additional surgeries booked per month.

## 8. OBJECTION HANDLING (INDIA-SPECIFIC)

### Objection 1: "Will the AI sound natural in Hindi?"

> "Great question. Here's what's changed in the last 12 months — voice AI models now handle Hindi-English code-switching naturally. Not like the robotic IVR you're used to. Conversational. Real pauses. Real tone. Let me play you a sample — or better, call this number and talk to it yourself."

### Objection 2: "Patients will know it's a robot and hang up."

> "That's the #1 concern everyone has. Here's what we've found: in outbound calling, the conversation is structured — 'How are you feeling about the surgery? Do you have questions?' — the AI handles this better than most entry-level callers because it's consistent, polite, and never rushed. Also, we can identify the call as being from O'Positive Health with AI assistance, which actually increases trust because patients know the call is recorded and professional.
> 
> But here's the real point: even if 10% of patients prefer a human, the AI handles the other 90% — and that's the 90% your team doesn't have bandwidth for today."

### Objection 3: "What about TRAI regulations and DND?"

> "We build compliance into the system. The AI only calls within TRAI-approved hours (9 AM - 9 PM). We integrate DND registry scrubbing before any call is made. Every call is logged with timestamp and consent tracking. You'll actually be more compliant than manual calling, because humans forget to check. The system never does."

### Objection 4: "We already benchmarked pricing at $0.12-$0.20/minute. What do you charge?"

> "The per-minute cost for the voice AI is in that range — that's the raw calling cost. What you're also getting from us is the full system: the conversation design, the intent classification, the CRM integration, the automated follow-ups, and the reporting dashboard. The per-minute cost is the commodity. The system that makes those calls intelligent and actionable — that's what you're buying."

### Objection 5: "Can this integrate with our CRM?"

> "If your CRM has an API, yes. If it doesn't, we can work with database-level integration or build a middleware layer. On the first call, I'll need 15 minutes with your tech team to understand the CRM setup — and then I'll scope the integration in the proposal."

### Objection 6: "How is this different from an IVR or auto-dialer?"

> "An auto-dialer dials the number and plays a recorded message. An IVR gives you 'Press 1 for English, Press 2 for Hindi.' Neither of these have a conversation.
> 
> Our AI actually talks. It asks questions. It listens to the answer. It classifies intent based on what the patient says — not what button they press. And it remembers. If this patient called your helpline last week, the AI knows. It's not a dialer. It's a coordinator that happens to use the phone."

### Objection 7: "What if patients have medical questions the AI can't answer?"

> "The AI is designed to triage, not diagnose. If a patient asks a medical question, the AI says: 'That's a great question — let me connect you with our medical coordinator who can help with that.' It routes the call or schedules a callback with the right person. The AI handles the 80% of routine calls. Your medical team handles the 20% that requires expertise."

## 10. DM / REACHOUT SEQUENCE

### Channel: LinkedIn (Primary)

**Who to message:**
- Akshay Bhatia (Founder & CEO)
- Prateek Shukla (COO — operational champion)

### Pre-DM Warm-Up (1-2 Weeks)

Since this is an active lead (they've already expressed intent), the warm-up can be compressed:

**Week 1:**
- Connect with Akshay and Prateek on LinkedIn
- Like/comment on 2-3 of O'Positive Health's posts
- If they've shared any content about their patient journey, milestones, or healthcare impact — leave a thoughtful comment:

> "The hospital-agnostic model makes a lot of sense for India — patients shouldn't have to figure out which specialist at which hospital. Curious how you're handling the scale of patient coordination as the network grows."

**Week 1-2: The DM**

Since they're an active lead, skip the 3-week warm-up and go direct:

**DM to Prateek (COO — Operational Champion):**

> Hey Prateek,
> 
> I heard about O'Positive Health's interest in AI calling for patient outreach — specifically re-engaging 1,000-2,000 past patients to determine surgery intent.
> 
> This is exactly what we build. We're a 3-person AI studio. We build outbound AI callers that have real conversations with patients (Hindi + English), classify their intent, and update the CRM — without any manual data entry.
> 
> We built this for a clinic that was making 50-100 manual calls a day. Their AI handled 300 calls in Week 1. 47 appointments booked.
> 
> I can show you a 5-minute demo. Want me to send it over?

**DM to Akshay (Founder — Strategic Decision Maker):**

> Hey Akshay,
> 
> Been looking at what O'Positive Health is doing — the hospital-agnostic surgical platform model is sharp. I also understand you're exploring AI calling for patient re-engagement.
> 
> Quick question — are you looking for someone to build the full AI system (conversation + CRM integration + follow-up automation), or are you mainly looking for a calling API?
> 
> We build the full system. Happy to show you what it looks like in 5 minutes.

### Follow-Up Rules

- If no response in 48 hours → Do NOT follow up immediately
- Engage with a O'Positive post (like or comment)
- After 5-7 days, send one follow-up with a demo link:

> Hey [Name], no worries if the timing's off. Just recorded a quick demo of an AI system we built for patient outreach — [Loom link]. Does similar to what you're looking for. Happy to chat whenever.

- If no response after follow-up → Move on. Maximum 2 DMs ever.

## 11. MARKET VALIDATION AMMO

### Evidence to Share During the Pitch

**1. US Healthcare AI Calling — Proven**
- AI calling for patient re-engagement is already standard in US healthcare. Companies like Luma Health, Relatient, and CareVoice AI handle millions of patient outreach calls.
- Their own requirement brief references this: "Similar AI use cases proven in US clinics."
- Frame: "This isn't new. It's proven in the US. We're adapting it for the Indian market with Hindi/English capability and Indian CRM integration."

**2. India Healthcare Tech is Booming**
- Practo, mFine, and DocsApp have proven that Indian patients are comfortable with tech-mediated healthcare interactions
- WhatsApp-based patient coordination (which O'Positive already uses) shows their patient base is tech-friendly
- The jump from "WhatsApp coordination" to "AI phone call" is natural for this patient demographic

**3. Cost Arbitrage**
- A US AI calling system costs $5,000-$15,000 to build + $0.15-$0.25/minute
- We can deliver the same system at India pricing — significant cost advantage while maintaining the same voice AI quality (models are cloud-based, not geography-dependent)

**4. Dissonance Setup (From Persuasion Architecture Framework)**

Use this on the call:

> **Belief A**: "We need to reach 2,000 patients quickly."
> **Belief B**: "Our 10 employees max out at 1,000 calls per day, with inconsistent quality."
> **Conflict**: If speed and consistency matter, and humans can't provide both at this volume...
> **Resolution**: "An AI system that calls 2,000 patients in 2 days with perfect consistency isn't replacing your team — it's giving your team the output of 50 employees."

### Timeline: 4-5 Weeks

| Week | Phase | Deliverables |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Week 1** | Discovery & Audit | Map current calling script → Design AI conversation flow → Audit CRM for API capability → Define intent categories → Identify Hindi/English split → TRAI compliance check |
| **Week 2** | Build (Voice + Memory) | Build voice agent (Hindi/English) → Train on O'Positive's conversation script → Integrate patient data memory → Test voice quality and latency on Indian telecom |
| **Week 3** | Build (Automation + CRM) | CRM integration (read patient data, write call results) → Build intent classification logic → Set up automated follow-up triggers (WhatsApp, care coordinator assignment) → Build daily reporting dashboard |
| **Week 4** | Test | Run AI calls on 50-100 test patients → O'Positive team reviews every call recording → Refine conversation flow → Fix edge cases (wrong number handling, voicemail, callback scheduling) |
| **Week 5** | Go Live + Monitor | Launch on full patient database → Daily monitoring for first 2 weeks → Weekly optimization → Handover of reporting dashboard to COO |

### Post-Launch Maintenance

- **First 30 days**: Daily monitoring, same-day fixes

## QUICK REFERENCE CARD

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Lead** | O'Positive Health (opositivehealth.com) |
| **AI Role** | AI Patient Outreach Coordinator |
| **Pitch** | "We build an AI that calls your 2,000 past patients, identifies who's ready for surgery, and updates your CRM — in days, not weeks." |
| **Key Pain** | 10 employees, 50-100 calls/day each, can't cover 2,000 patients fast enough |
| **ROI Hook** | Each unconverted patient = ₹50K-₹5L in lost surgery revenue. AI recovers 30-80 conversions/month. |
| **Differentiator** | Full system (voice + memory + automation), not just a dialer. Bilingual. CRM-integrated. TRAI-compliant. |
| **Budget Range** | Setup ₹2L-3.5L + ₹50K-1L/month maintenance + per-minute calling |
| **Timeline** | 4-5 weeks from kickoff to go-live |
| **Decision Makers** | Akshay Bhatia (CEO), Prateek Shukla (COO) |
| **Market Validation** | Proven in US clinics; O'Positive has already researched this |
| **Language** | Hindi + English (bilingual conversations) |
