AGENTIC AI LABS: MARKETING CHANNELS
================================================================

The logic: A scaling founder goes through a predictable journey. At each stage, they show up in specific places. Our job is to be visible at the right place, at the right moment, with the right message.


THE FOUNDER'S JOURNEY (AND WHERE WE INTERCEPT)

  Stage 1: Founder gets traction, starts feeling operational pain
    They're in: LinkedIn, Twitter, founder communities
    Our play: Content that names their pain before they can

  Stage 2: Founder tries to solve it with DIY tools (Zapier, Vapi, ChatGPT)
    They're in: n8n community, ElevenLabs Discord, Make.com, GHL groups, Reddit
    Our play: Be the helpful expert answering their questions

  Stage 3: DIY breaks in production. Founder realizes they need real help.
    They're in: Upwork, Google search, asking their network
    Our play: Be the first name that comes up (Upwork repositioning, SEO, referrals)

  Stage 4: Founder evaluates options and picks a partner
    They're in: Our website, checking our LinkedIn, asking for demos
    Our play: Live demo, case studies, proof that we've done this before


================================================================
ALL CHANNELS (WHAT, WHY, HOW)
================================================================


1. LINKEDIN (ADITYA'S PERSONAL PROFILE)
----------------------------------------------------------------

  Why this channel:
    Every non-technical founder at the 1-10 stage is on LinkedIn. They scroll daily. They follow other founders. When they're thinking about scaling, this is where they consume content and discover people. LinkedIn is also where recently-funded founders announce their raises - that announcement is a buying signal. They just got money and now need to build.

  Strategy:
    - Post 3x per week minimum
    - Content mix: 60% Pillar 1 (Tools vs Systems), 30% Pillar 3 (Founder Journey), 10% Pillar 5 (Results/Proof)
    - Find 20 founders who recently announced a Seed or Series A raise
    - Engage with their posts genuinely for 2-3 weeks (comment, react, add value)
    - After building visibility, send a simple DM: "Been following your journey since the raise. Curious - are you building your AI layer in-house or working with someone?"
    - Do this with 5 new founders per week
    - Never pitch in posts. Educate, provoke, tell stories. Let DMs come to you.

  What to post:
    - "Everyone's building AI agents. Nobody's building AI systems. Here's the difference."
    - "We took over a founder's AI setup after 3 months of DIY. Here's what was broken."
    - "A voice agent without memory is a parrot. Here's what I mean."
    - Personal stories about shifting from SaaS dev to AI systems

  Metric to track: DMs received per week from founders asking about AI


2. UPWORK (REPOSITION, NOT ABANDON)
----------------------------------------------------------------

  Why this channel:
    You already have a top-rated account. Deal flow exists. The problem isn't Upwork itself - it's the type of jobs you're bidding on. 1-10 stage founders with real budgets also post on Upwork, but they post different kinds of jobs than MVP clients.

  Strategy:
    - Stop bidding on: "build me an MVP," "create a chatbot," "simple automation"
    - Start bidding on: "scale my existing app," "integrate AI into our product," "rebuild/fix my automation," "need a voice agent for production use," "looking for AI development partner"
    - Filter for budgets above $5K
    - In every proposal, position as an AI systems builder, not a freelancer
    - After completing a project, convert the client to a direct relationship off Upwork for ongoing work
    - Treat Upwork as a client acquisition channel, not a permanent home

  What to say in proposals:
    "We're an AI systems studio (3 co-founders, not a freelancer). We build production-grade AI that talks to your customers, remembers interactions, and takes action across your tools. Here's a relevant case study..."

  Metric to track: Conversion rate from Upwork client to direct/repeat client


3. GHL (GOHIGHLEVEL) FACEBOOK GROUPS & COMMUNITY
----------------------------------------------------------------

  Why this channel:
    GHL is used by thousands of marketing agencies. These agency owners sell "AI-powered services" to their end clients (dental practices, real estate firms, local businesses) but most of them cannot actually build the AI. They need a technical partner. One agency relationship = 3-5 projects per year. This is the highest leverage B2B channel for you.

  Strategy:
    - Join the top 3-5 GHL Facebook groups and the official GHL community
    - For the first 2-3 weeks, only help. Answer questions about AI automation, voice agents, integrating AI with GHL
    - Share short demos or walkthroughs: "Here's how we connected a voice agent to a GHL workflow for a dental client"
    - After building credibility, start DMing active agency owners: "I noticed you're offering AI services. We're a technical team that builds the AI systems for agencies like yours. Want to see a demo?"
    - Propose white-label partnerships: you build, they sell under their brand
    - Target: 3-5 agency partnerships within 90 days

  What to share:
    - "Built this voice agent that plugs into GHL. Books appointments, updates contacts, triggers follow-up sequences. Here's a 2-minute walkthrough."
    - Answer questions like: "How do I add AI to my GHL setup?" with genuine, detailed help

  Metric to track: Number of agency partnerships signed


4. N8N COMMUNITY
----------------------------------------------------------------

  Why this channel:
    n8n is where technical and semi-technical founders go when Zapier isn't enough. These people are actively trying to build AI workflows themselves. They hit walls constantly - especially when they need voice, memory, or complex multi-step AI logic. This is a Stage 2 channel (they're trying DIY and struggling).

  Strategy:
    - Join the n8n community forum and Discord
    - Monitor questions about AI agents, voice integration, memory, and complex workflows
    - Answer with real depth. Show your expertise. Don't pitch.
    - When someone posts "how do I make my AI agent remember previous conversations" or "how do I connect a voice agent to n8n," you give the best answer in the thread
    - People who see consistently great answers will DM you or check your profile
    - Link your LinkedIn or website in your profile

  What to share:
    - Detailed answers to technical questions
    - "Here's how we solved [specific problem] for a client" mini case studies
    - Workflow templates or architecture diagrams that show the voice + memory + automation stack

  Metric to track: DMs and profile visits from community members


5. ELEVENLABS / SMALLEST AI DISCORD
----------------------------------------------------------------

  Why this channel:
    These are the communities where people are actively building voice agents. Most are developers or founders experimenting. They get a demo working fast but then hit production challenges - latency, concurrent calls, integration with CRMs, memory across conversations. This is exactly where your expertise becomes valuable.

  Strategy:
    - Join the official Discord servers for ElevenLabs and Smallest AI
    - Be present in channels where people ask about production use cases, integrations, and scaling
    - When someone asks "how do I deploy this to handle real customer calls" or "how do I make the agent remember context," that's your moment
    - Share how you've solved these problems in production
    - Build a reputation as "the person who knows how to make voice agents actually work in real businesses"

  What to share:
    - Production tips and gotchas that only come from real deployment experience
    - Architecture approaches for connecting voice to memory and automation
    - Short case study snippets: "We deployed a voice agent for [industry]. Here's what we learned."

  Metric to track: DMs from developers/founders asking for help with production deployment


6. MAKE.COM COMMUNITY
----------------------------------------------------------------

  Why this channel:
    Similar to n8n but with a different audience - more non-technical, more visual builders. These people are trying to automate workflows and many are experimenting with adding AI. They represent the earlier end of the DIY journey. When their Make scenarios become too complex (especially with AI), they look for help.

  Strategy:
    - Same approach as n8n: help first, never pitch
    - Focus on threads about AI integration, voice bots, and complex multi-step automations
    - Position as someone who builds what Make can't handle alone

  Metric to track: Inbound inquiries from community participation


7. TWITTER / X
----------------------------------------------------------------

  Why this channel:
    The AI builder community lives on Twitter. This is where AI discourse happens in real-time. Founders, developers, VCs, and agency owners all hang out here. It's faster and more real-time than LinkedIn. Also where "broken AI" stories go viral - people love sharing their DIY failures.

  Strategy:
    - Post 3-5x per week
    - Content mix: Pillar 1 (Tools vs Systems) + Pillar 4 (Broken AI Stories)
    - Use hook patterns from your personal style guide: "You spent 3 months building an AI agent. It forgot your customer's name on the second call. Here's why."
    - Engage with AI builder accounts, founder accounts, and VC accounts
    - Quote-tweet interesting AI takes with your "systems vs tools" perspective
    - Use threads for deeper breakdowns: "How we built an AI system that handles 300 calls/month. Thread:"

  What to post:
    - Short provocative takes: "Your AI agent has amnesia. And you're charging customers for it."
    - Behind-the-scenes of building AI systems
    - Quick before/after results
    - "Broken AI" teardowns

  Metric to track: Followers in target audience, DMs, profile link clicks


8. YOUTUBE
----------------------------------------------------------------

  Why this channel:
    YouTube is where people go to learn HOW things work. When a founder is evaluating whether to hire an AI agency or do it themselves, they search YouTube. Demos and walkthroughs are the most compelling proof format. A 5-minute video of you building a voice agent and connecting it to memory and automation is worth more than any sales page.

  Strategy:
    - Post 2-4 videos per month
    - Types: Demo walkthroughs, case study breakdowns, "how we built this" videos
    - Keep them practical and specific, not theoretical
    - Always show the actual system working (screen recordings, live calls to the AI)
    - Optimize titles for search: "How to build a production AI voice agent," "AI agent with memory - full walkthrough," "n8n + ElevenLabs + Mem0 tutorial"

  What to post:
    - "We built an AI receptionist for a dental practice. Here's the full system." (10 min)
    - "Voice Agent vs Voice System: Why your AI chatbot keeps forgetting people" (5 min)
    - "Full walkthrough: AI that talks, remembers, and acts" (15 min)
    - Short demos of actual working systems (1-2 min, also repurpose as Shorts)

  Metric to track: Views on demo videos, comments asking "can you build this for me," website traffic from YouTube


9. REDDIT (r/SaaS, r/startups, r/artificial, r/n8n)
----------------------------------------------------------------

  Why this channel:
    Founders post their real problems on Reddit. They ask questions like "has anyone used AI for customer support?" or "looking for recommendations for an AI voice agent." These are buying signals disguised as questions. Reddit also ranks well on Google, so your answers get found by people searching later.

  Strategy:
    - Monitor relevant subreddits daily (or set up alerts)
    - Answer questions with genuine, detailed help
    - Share your perspective on AI tools vs systems when relevant
    - Never self-promote directly. Let your answer quality speak. Put your company in your flair or profile.
    - When someone asks "can anyone recommend an AI agency," that's a direct lead

  Metric to track: Upvotes on answers, DMs from Reddit users


10. INDIE HACKERS
----------------------------------------------------------------

  Why this channel:
    Full of 1-10 stage founders building products. Many are non-technical or semi-technical. They're actively discussing growth challenges, operations, and tools. They're exactly your ICP. The community values transparency and real stories, which aligns with your founder-led voice.

  Strategy:
    - Post in the community about your journey: shifting from dev agency to AI systems
    - Share lessons learned, results, and honest takes
    - Engage in threads about AI, automation, and scaling operations
    - Don't sell. Tell your story. The right founders will reach out.

  Metric to track: Profile views, DMs, website traffic from Indie Hackers


11. FRACTIONAL CTO PARTNERSHIPS
----------------------------------------------------------------

  Why this channel:
    Fractional CTOs advise non-technical founders on technology decisions. When the founder says "okay, now build it," the fractional CTO needs a builder to hand the work to. If you're their trusted builder, every client they advise becomes a potential client for you. One fractional CTO relationship = 2-4 referrals per year.

  Strategy:
    - Search LinkedIn for "Fractional CTO" or "Part-time CTO" or "Technical Advisor for Startups"
    - Identify 10 active ones who work with 1-10 stage founders
    - Send a warm message: "I run an AI systems studio. We build voice + memory + automation systems for founders. I'm looking for fractional CTOs to partner with - we build, you advise. Happy to offer a 10-15% referral fee for introductions."
    - Offer to do a free 30-minute consultation with their first referral so they can see your quality
    - Make it zero-risk for them to refer you

  Metric to track: Number of active fractional CTO partnerships, referrals received per quarter


12. GHL AGENCY PARTNERSHIPS (WHITE-LABEL)
----------------------------------------------------------------

  Why this channel:
    This is the highest-volume channel on this list. GHL agencies serve local businesses (dental, real estate, fitness, home services). Each agency has 10-50+ clients. They all want to offer "AI" but can't build it. If you become the technical backend for 3-5 agencies, that's potentially 15-50 projects without doing any outbound. The agency finds the client, sells the service, and you build the AI system under their brand.

  Strategy:
    - Identify agencies already marketing "AI services" or "AI chatbots" on their GHL profiles
    - Propose a partnership: "You sell, we build. White-labeled under your brand."
    - Create a simple partnership pitch: here's what we build, here's the timeline, here's the pricing for you (wholesale), here's what you charge your client (retail)
    - Start with 1 agency as a pilot. Deliver great work. Let them refer other agency owners.
    - This should be a major focus by month 3

  Metric to track: Number of agency partners, projects per agency per quarter


13. VC / ANGEL INVESTOR RELATIONSHIPS
----------------------------------------------------------------

  Why this channel:
    VCs fund founders. Founders immediately need to build. If a VC trusts you, they recommend you to their portfolio companies. One VC relationship = access to 10-30 portfolio companies, many of which will need AI systems.

  Strategy:
    - This is the longest-play channel. Don't rush it.
    - Start by engaging with the content of VCs who invest in seed/Series A companies
    - Comment thoughtfully on their portfolio companies' announcements
    - Offer to build an AI system for one portfolio company at a discount as a proof case
    - Once you deliver results, ask the VC for an intro to other portfolio companies
    - Target: 1-2 warm VC relationships within 6 months

  Metric to track: Portfolio company introductions received


14. WEBSITE + SEO (TRYAGENTIKAI.COM)
----------------------------------------------------------------

  Why this channel:
    When a founder's DIY AI breaks and they google "AI voice agent for business" or "production AI system company" or "fix my AI chatbot," your website should appear. SEO is a long-term play but it compounds. Every blog post and case study is a permanent asset that captures search traffic.

  Strategy:
    - Publish 2-4 blog posts per month targeting search terms like:
      "AI voice agent for [industry]"
      "production AI system for startups"
      "how to scale AI automation"
      "voice agent not working in production"
      "AI agent with memory"
    - Every blog post should include a CTA to the live demo or a consultation
    - Case studies should be optimized for "[industry] + AI" searches
    - The website itself must clearly communicate the Tools vs Systems positioning

  Metric to track: Organic traffic, leads from blog posts


15. LIVE DEMO (PHONE NUMBER / CHAT WIDGET)
----------------------------------------------------------------

  Why this channel:
    This isn't a traditional marketing channel - it's a proof asset you embed everywhere. A phone number that anyone can call to talk to an AI system you built is the most powerful sales tool possible. It eliminates all skepticism instantly. "Don't take our word for it. Call the AI."

  Strategy:
    - Build one flagship demo AI system (voice agent + memory + automation)
    - Get a dedicated phone number for it
    - Embed the number or a chat widget on:
      Your website homepage
      Your LinkedIn profile/posts
      Your email signature
      Your Upwork proposals
      Your community profiles
    - Update the demo periodically to showcase new capabilities
    - Every piece of content should link to the demo

  Metric to track: Demo calls/chats per week, conversion from demo to consultation


16. EMAIL SIGNATURE
----------------------------------------------------------------

  Why this channel:
    Every email you send is a touchpoint. A well-crafted email signature with your one-liner and a link to the live demo turns every conversation into a passive marketing moment.

  Strategy:
    - Format:
      Aditya | Agentic AI Labs
      We build AI systems that run parts of your business.
      Talk to our AI: [phone number / demo link]
      tryagentikai.com

  Metric to track: Clicks on demo link from email signature

THE MATH THAT MATTERS
================================================================

You don't need 1000 leads. You need 5 relationships that compound.

  2 Fractional CTOs x 3 referrals/year each = 6 projects/year
  2 GHL Agency Partners x 4 projects/year each = 8 projects/year
  1 VC relationship x 2 portfolio intros/year = 2 projects/year
  LinkedIn/Twitter inbound = 4-6 projects/year
  Upwork (repositioned) = 4-6 projects/year

  Total: 24-28 projects/year at $10-30K average = $240K-$840K/year

  This is achievable within 6-9 months of consistent execution across these channels.


================================================================

Focus beats volume. Pick the top 3 channels for the first 30 days. Execute consistently. Add channels only after the first 3 are working.

Your first 30 days: LinkedIn + Upwork + GHL communities. Nothing else.
