AGENTIC AI LABS: TEAM PLAYBOOK
================================================================
Internal Document — For the Marketing & Sales Team
Last Updated: 2026-02-10

Read this once. Pin it. Reference it before every call, every
DM, every piece of content, every SEO brief.


================================================================
PART 1: WHO WE ARE (60-SECOND VERSION)
================================================================

We're Agentic AI Labs. Three technical co-founders.

We used to build SaaS apps. Then AI happened. We watched every
founder try to build AI themselves — chatbots, voice agents,
automations. All of them worked as demos. All of them broke
with real customers.

We now build the thing that actually works: a complete AI system
where voice, memory, and automation are connected into one unit.

Website: tryagentikai.com
Founder: Aditya
Team: 3 technical co-founders (design + development)


================================================================
PART 2: WHAT WE ACTUALLY BUILD
================================================================

We build ONE thing. Not three things. ONE integrated system.

That system has three layers under the hood:

  Voice/Chat → The AI talks to customers (calls, chat)
  Memory     → The AI remembers every customer, every conversation
  Automation → The AI takes action (books appointments, updates
               CRM, sends follow-ups, qualifies leads)

These three layers are NOT separate products. They are not a menu.
We never sell "just voice" or "just automation." We sell one
working system where all three are connected.

Why this matters:
  A voice agent without memory forgets your customer's name on
  the second call.
  A voice agent without automation can talk but can't DO anything.
  We build the thing that talks, remembers, AND acts.

The one-liner you should memorize:

  "We build AI systems that run parts of your business autonomously."

The components (voice, memory, automation) are commodities.
Anyone can buy Vapi or Zapier. Our X factor is that we integrate
all three into one production-grade system that actually works
with real customers — not just in a demo.


================================================================
PART 3: THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THIS DOCUMENT
================================================================

Read this section twice.

OUR POSITIONING AND OUR PITCH ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.

  POSITIONING = Who we are to the world.
    "We build AI systems."
    This goes on the website, LinkedIn bios, brand content.
    It's abstract. It's a category. It's identity.

  PITCH = What we say to one specific person to get them interested.
    "We build your AI Receptionist that answers every call,
    books appointments, and sends confirmations — 24/7."
    This goes in DMs, calls, proposals, outreach, ad copy.
    It's concrete. It's tangible. It's a specific outcome.

Why this distinction matters for YOU:

  If you're writing SEO content → use the POSITIONING language
  If you're on a call with a prospect → use the PITCH language
  If you're setting an appointment → use the PITCH language
  If you're writing a LinkedIn post → use the POSITIONING language

  NEVER pitch a prospect by saying "we build AI systems."
  That's too abstract. They nod and move on.

  ALWAYS pitch by describing the specific AI ROLE we build
  for their specific business.


================================================================
PART 4: THE AI ROLE FRAMEWORK (HOW WE PITCH)
================================================================

We don't pitch "AI systems." We pitch an AI ROLE — a specific
AI employee that does a specific job in their business.

The formula:

  "We build your AI [ROLE] that [ACTION CHAIN]."

The role makes it tangible — they can picture it.
The action chain makes it credible — they can see the steps.
The system behind it makes it defensible — but we don't lead
with the system. We lead with the role.


HERE ARE THE ROLES BY INDUSTRY:

  DENTAL / MEDICAL / CLINICS
  Role: AI Receptionist
  Pitch: "We build an AI receptionist that answers every call,
  books appointments into your calendar, remembers returning
  patients, and sends confirmations. 24/7, no missed calls."

  RECRUITING / HR
  Role: AI Interviewer
  Pitch: "We build an AI interviewer that conducts first-round
  voice screenings, scores candidates on your criteria, and
  pushes qualified ones into your pipeline — so your team only
  talks to people worth talking to."

  MARKETING AGENCIES
  Role: AI SDR
  Pitch: "We build an AI SDR that calls leads, qualifies them,
  books meetings on the sales rep's calendar, and updates the
  CRM. White-labeled under your brand."

  E-COMMERCE
  Role: AI Support Rep
  Pitch: "We build an AI support agent that handles returns,
  order status, and product questions — and remembers each
  customer's history so they never repeat themselves."

  REAL ESTATE
  Role: AI Showing Coordinator
  Pitch: "We build an AI showing coordinator that answers
  property inquiries, qualifies buyers, schedules showings,
  and syncs everything to your CRM."

  HOME SERVICES (HVAC, PLUMBING, ROOFING)
  Role: AI Dispatch Agent
  Pitch: "We build an AI dispatch agent that answers service
  calls, qualifies urgency, books service windows, and notifies
  your technicians."

  FITNESS / GYMS
  Role: AI Membership Advisor
  Pitch: "We build an AI membership advisor that answers
  prospect calls, books trial classes, and re-engages members
  who stopped showing up."

  LEGAL
  Role: AI Intake Specialist
  Pitch: "We build an AI intake specialist that answers calls,
  qualifies case type, and schedules consultations — so your
  team only talks to real cases."


IF YOU ENCOUNTER A NEW INDUSTRY:
  1. Identify the repetitive human role the AI replaces
  2. Name the AI after that role
  3. Describe the action chain (what it does step by step)
  4. The system under the hood is always the same:
     voice + memory + automation


================================================================
PART 5: WHO WE SELL TO
================================================================

PRIMARY BUYER: Non-technical founders at the 1-10 stage.

  - They have a working product and real revenue
  - They're post-validation, pre-scale
  - They're drowning in manual, repetitive work
  - They've tried DIY (ChatGPT, Zapier, basic chatbots) and
    hit the wall — it works as a demo, breaks in production
  - Budget: $5K-$50K+ per project
  - They want a system that works WITHOUT them, not another
    tool to manage

  The sentence that describes their moment:
    "My product is working. My operations aren't keeping up.
    I need AI that actually runs part of my business."

SECONDARY BUYER: Marketing agencies (GHL agencies).

  - They sell AI services to local businesses but can't build it
  - They need a technical backend partner
  - We build, they sell under their brand (white-label)
  - One agency = 3-5 projects per year

DO NOT PURSUE:
  - $500-$2K "build me a chatbot" clients
  - People who just want a quick demo with no real business need
  - Clients who want to dictate the architecture
  - Anyone who says "just a simple automation"


================================================================
PART 6: HOW WE SOUND (VOICE & TONE)
================================================================

We sound like Aditya talking to another founder over coffee.
Not a corporate agency. Not a hype-bro. A builder explaining
what he built and why it works.

RULES:

  Be conversational.
    Say: "Here's the thing about AI agents — most of them are parrots."
    Don't say: "Our AI solutions leverage advanced NLP capabilities."

  Be specific.
    Say: "This AI handled 300 calls last week for a dental practice."
    Don't say: "We deliver cutting-edge results."

  Be honest about limitations.
    Say: "AI won't replace your sales team. But it handles the 80%
    that's routine so your team focuses on the 20% that closes deals."
    Don't say: "Our AI replaces your entire team."

  Show, don't claim.
    Say: "Call this number. Talk to the AI. That's our work."
    Don't say: "We're the best AI agency in the market."

  Talk outcomes, not technology.
    Say: "Your AI books 50 appointments a month without a human."
    Don't say: "We use ElevenLabs + Mem0 + n8n integrated via API."


WORDS WE USE:                    WORDS WE NEVER USE:
  AI systems                       AI solutions
  Production-grade                 Cutting-edge
  Autonomous                       Automated
  Build                            Leverage
  Your AI system                   Our platform
  Works without you                Seamless
  Talk, Remember, Act              End-to-end


================================================================
PART 7: WHAT EACH ROLE DOES (ACTIONABLE)
================================================================


FOR CALL SETTERS / APPOINTMENT SETTERS:
---------------------------------------

Your job: Get the prospect to agree to a 15-minute call with our
team. That's it. You don't close. You open.

What you need to know about the prospect BEFORE the call:
  - What industry are they in?
  - What's their likely pain? (see Part 4 for industry mapping)
  - Are they a founder or an agency owner?

Your opening (for founders):
  "Hey [Name], we build AI [ROLE] for [INDUSTRY] businesses.
  It [2-3 actions from the action chain]. I'd love to set up
  a quick 15-minute call to see if it's relevant to what
  you're doing. Not a sales pitch — just a fit check."

Your opening (for agency owners):
  "Hey [Name], we're the technical team behind AI services for
  marketing agencies. We build, you sell, white-labeled under
  your brand. Worth a 15-minute call to see how it works?"

What NOT to do:
  - Don't explain the three layers (voice, memory, automation)
  - Don't talk about our tech stack
  - Don't say "AI systems" — say the specific AI Role
  - Don't pitch. Your only goal is the meeting.

Objection you'll hear most:
  "We're not looking for AI right now."
  Your response: "Totally fair. Can I send you a 60-second demo
  of what we built for a [similar industry] business? If it's
  relevant, great. If not, no worries."
  Then send the live demo link. Let the demo re-open the door.


FOR PITCHING / SALES TEAM:
---------------------------

Your job: Close the deal on the call. Convert interest into a
signed project.

Call structure (15-20 minutes):

  Minutes 1-3: Ask about THEIR business.
    "Tell me about your business. What does your day look like?
    Where are you spending the most time on repetitive work?"

  Minutes 3-8: Show the AI Role (through their lens).
    Pick the right role for their industry. Describe the action
    chain. Then say: "Want to hear it? Call this number."
    Let them talk to the live demo. The demo sells.

  Minutes 8-12: Business outcome.
    "This system handles [X] calls/tasks per month. Your team
    stops doing [repetitive thing]. You get [time/money] back."

  Minutes 12-15: Process and next step.
    "Week 1 we audit your workflows. Week 2 we build. Week 3
    we test with real scenarios. Week 4 you're live."
    If they're ready: send proposal same day.
    If they need time: send the demo link + one case study.

Key rules:
  - Lead with their pain, not our capability
  - Use the AI Role name, not "AI system"
  - Always demo. The demo converts better than any slide deck.
  - Never trash competitors. Say: "Tools are great for getting
    started. Systems are what you need to scale."
  - If they ask about price before seeing value, redirect:
    "Let me show you what it does first, then we'll talk about
    what makes sense for your budget."


FOR SEO / CONTENT TEAM:
------------------------

Your job: Make us the first result when someone searches for
AI solutions in our target industries.

Content positioning: Use "AI systems" language.
  We are the AI SYSTEMS company. We own that word. Every piece
  of content should reinforce "systems vs tools."

SEO keyword clusters to target:

  Industry-specific (high intent):
    "AI receptionist for dental practice"
    "AI voice agent for real estate"
    "AI appointment booking for clinics"
    "AI interviewer for recruiting"
    "AI customer support for ecommerce"
    "AI dispatch agent for home services"
    "AI lead qualification for agencies"

  Problem-aware (mid intent):
    "AI chatbot not working in production"
    "voice agent keeps forgetting customers"
    "how to scale AI automation"
    "AI agent with memory"
    "fix broken AI chatbot"
    "AI demo vs production"

  Category-level (awareness):
    "AI tools vs AI systems"
    "production grade AI for business"
    "AI systems for startups"
    "autonomous AI for small business"

Content pillars (all content falls into one):

  1. Tools vs Systems — establish the category
     "Why your AI chatbot forgets everything"
     "The gap between demo and production"

  2. How AI Systems Work — demonstrate expertise
     "How we built an AI receptionist that handles 300 calls/month"

  3. Founder's Journey — Aditya's personal stories
     "We used to build MVPs. Here's why we stopped."

  4. Broken AI Stories — capture people at the failure moment
     "We took over a founder's AI after 3 months of DIY."

  5. Results & Proof — case studies, numbers
     "This AI handled 300 calls last week. Here's the recording."

Blog post structure:
  - Every post targets one keyword cluster
  - Every post includes a CTA to the live demo or consultation
  - Every case study should be optimized for "[industry] + AI"
  - Use the AI Role names in headlines: "AI Receptionist" not
    "AI Voice Agent Solution"

What to NEVER write:
  - "Cutting-edge AI solutions" (corporate jargon, kills trust)
  - "We leverage advanced technology" (nobody talks like this)
  - Feature-first content (always lead with business outcome)
  - Generic AI content that any competitor could publish


================================================================
PART 8: OUR X FACTOR (WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT)
================================================================

If a prospect asks "why you and not someone else?" — here it is:

  1. We're the integration, not the component.
     Anyone can buy a voice agent (Vapi). Anyone can set up
     automation (Zapier). Anyone can add memory (Mem0). Nobody
     integrates all three into one system that works in
     production. We do.

  2. Production-grade, not demo-grade.
     Our AI handles real customers, real calls, real edge cases.
     We test until it breaks, fix it, and test again. Most AI
     agencies deliver a demo. We deliver a system that runs.

  3. The AI gets smarter over time.
     Because of the memory layer, our AI remembers every
     interaction. Month 2 is better than month 1. Month 6 is
     better than month 3. This doesn't happen with standalone
     tools. It only happens with an integrated system.

  4. Three technical co-founders. Not freelancers.
     We're a team that's built 50+ systems. We know what breaks
     at scale and how to prevent it. We're not learning on your
     project.

  5. Live demo as proof.
     "Don't take our word for it. Call the AI."
     Most agencies can't demo live. We can.

Statements only WE can make (the competitor test):
  - "We integrate voice, memory, and automation into one
     production-grade system." (No single-tool company can)
  - "Your AI gets smarter every month because it remembers
     every conversation." (No automation agency can)
  - "Call this number and talk to a system we built."
     (Most agencies can't demo live)


================================================================
PART 9: PROOF WE USE TO BACK UP EVERY CLAIM
================================================================

Every bold claim needs proof. Here's the hierarchy:

  #1: Live Demo
  "Call this number. Talk to the AI. That's our work."
  Use everywhere. Website, DMs, calls, proposals, email signature.

  #2: Specific Numbers
  "300 calls handled. 12 appointments booked. 0 human intervention."
  Use in case studies, landing pages, social proof.

  #3: Before / After
  "Before: 2 humans, 8 hours/day, 50 calls.
   After: 1 AI system, 24/7, 300 calls."
  Use in case studies, pitches.

  #4: Client Quotes
  "We stopped hiring for customer support."
  Use on website, proposals.

  #5: Process Transparency
  "Week 1 audit. Week 2 build. Week 3 test. Week 4 live."
  Use in sales pages, proposals.

When in doubt: show, don't tell. Demo over deck. Numbers over
adjectives. Specifics over vague claims.


================================================================
PART 10: CHEAT SHEET
================================================================

Stick this next to your screen.

  WHO WE ARE:
  AI systems company. 3 technical co-founders.

  WHAT WE BUILD:
  One integrated AI system: voice + memory + automation.

  POSITIONING (website, bios, content):
  "We build AI systems that run parts of your business."

  PITCH (DMs, calls, proposals):
  "We build your AI [Role] that [action chain]."

  THE ROLES:
  Dental → AI Receptionist
  Recruiting → AI Interviewer
  Agencies → AI SDR
  E-commerce → AI Support Rep
  Real Estate → AI Showing Coordinator
  Home Services → AI Dispatch Agent
  Fitness → AI Membership Advisor
  Legal → AI Intake Specialist

  X FACTOR:
  Nobody else integrates voice + memory + automation into one
  production-grade system. Components are commodities.
  The integrated system is the moat.

  PROOF:
  "Call this number. Talk to the AI."

  THE CLIENT BUYS THE ROLE.
  THEY GET THE SYSTEM.
  THEY STAY BECAUSE OF THE MEMORY.
